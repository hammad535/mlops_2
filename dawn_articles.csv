Nepra approves Rs2.83 per unit hike in FCA for May power bills,https://www.dawn.com/news/1832270/nepra-approves-rs283-per-unit-hike-in-fca-for-may-power-bills,The increase applies to units billed in the month of March.,"The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Wednesday authorised ex-Wapda distribution companies (XWDiscos) to levy a Rs2.83 per unit charge in consumers’ electricity bills for May as part of fuel cost adjustment (FCA) charges. Nepra said the FCA pertains to the month of March. According to anotificationissued by Nepra, a copy of which is available withDawn.com, the new adjustment “shall be applicable to all the consumer categories except Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS) and lifeline consumers”. The notification added that this adjustment would be shown in consumers’ bills based on units billed in March. Last month, the government hadsought clearancefrom Nepra to extract about Rs23 billion additional in FCA  from consumers for electricity consumed in March despite 79 per cent of power generation coming from cheaper local fuels. The Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) — a subsidiary of the Power Division — had demanded Rs2.94 per unit additional fuel cost to recover from consumers through May bills. The proposed additional FCA was almost 46pc higher than the pre-fixed fuel cost of Rs6.44 per unit already charged to consumers in March. This raised questions about the power sector bureaucracy’s capabilities to forecast fuel costs even for six to seven months. In recent months, the additional FCAs have ranged between 50 and 115pc higher than the pre-determined fuel costs notified at the start of the current fiscal year. This FCA was on top of about a 26pc increase in the annual base tariff and another 10pc hike under the quarterly tariff adjustment currently in place and being charged to consumers at Rs2.75 per unit. As a result, consumers continue to pay excessive bills despite lower consumption patterns. Nepra had accepted the request for a public hearing on April 26. The higher proposed FCA for March is apparently mainly due to higher domestic coal and gas prices, although the use of imported fuels like coal, diesel and furnace oil remained zero. LNG was relatively cheaper, and the exchange rate remained stable. In a petition, the CPPA, acting as commercial agent of Discos, demanded an additional FCA of Rs2.94 per unit in the May bills for electricity consumed in March. It claimed that the reference fuel cost for March was Rs6.44 per unit, but the actual fuel cost rose to Rs9.38 per unit. The average fuel cost in February also stood at about Rs9.42 per unit. It said about 8,023-gigawatt-hour (GWh) of electricity was generated at an estimated fuel expenditure of Rs66.7bn (Rs8.3 per unit) in March, of which 7,756 GWh energy was delivered to Discos at the cost of Rs72.67bn (at Rs9.38 per unit). The data showed declining consumption trends. The consumption in March was also 8.3pc lower than the same month (8,459Gwh) last year. The Rs2.94 per unit FCA for March sought this year was more than double the Rs1.17 per unit FCA of the same month last year. In the April 26 hearing, Nepra hadcriticisedthe power companies for inefficiencies and the use of expensive power plants despite the availability of cheaper sources but had hinted at allowing them to charge another Rs22.8bn to consumers in the billing month of May."
"Sindh, Punjab bar councils announce lawyers’ strikes on May 9 after Lahore police clashes",https://www.dawn.com/news/1832241/sindh-punjab-bar-councils-announce-lawyers-strikes-on-may-9-after-lahore-police-clashes,Say lawyers to boycott court proceedings; PBC says protest to be marked with rallies and demonstrations.,"The Punjab Bar Council (PBC) and Sindh Bar Council (SBC) on Wednesday announced a strike by all lawyers and bar associations in the provinces for May 9 after clashes with the Lahore police. Lahore’s GPO Chowk became a battleground earlier today between riot police and lawyers after the latter staged a protest rally and attempted to enter the Lahore High Court (LHC). The lawyers’ attempts to gain entry into the high court were repelled by police, who baton-charged, fired tear gas at and used water cannons to disperse them. View this post on Instagram  Dawn.comcorrespondent Rana Bilal, present at the scene, reported that violence erupted as lawyers, including members from the Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA), demanded the dismissal of a terror case filed against fellow lawyers, and protested against the shifting of a court to a different location. The correspondent said that dozens of lawyers were arrested and wounded in police action, while some members of the press, law enforcement agencies and bystanders were also affected. Negotiations between the police and lawyers failed to resolve the impasse, the correspondent on the ground added. In a press release issued after a press conference held by the PBC, LHCBA and Lahore Bar Association (LBA), PBC Vice Chairman Kamran Bashir Mughal and Pir Imran Akram Bodla, chairman of the PBC executive committee announced a strike by all lawyers and bar associations in the province tomorrow (Thursday) against the LHC chief justice and police’s “thuggery”. They said rallies would be taken out against the treatment meted out to lawyers today and a protest would be registered. They said that the strike would be strictly ensured. They called for the Punjab police chief and chief minister to “come to their senses” and immediately release the detained lawyer. They also demanded that the Punjab police chief, Lahore’s top cop and deputy inspector general of police be immediately changed. The press release reiterated that lawyers would not appear in court on Thursday and would mark their protest through rallies and demonstrations. Separately, the SBC said it was in agreement with the PBC and also announced a strike and boycott of court proceedings for Thursday with instructions for advocates to not attend proceedings. The SBC demanded the federal and Punjab governments to take immediate notice of the matter, address the involvement of the Lahore police in the “shameful and inhuman” treatment of lawyers and take action against the responsible police officials. The council condemned the “excessive and unwarranted use of police force” against lawyers and termed it a “shameful act” that was a grave violation of the force’s duty and discipline. The Karachi Bar Association also announced a boycott and sent a letter to the sessions judges of the city’s districts to suspend judicial work and issue the same directions to their subordinate courts. Speaking toDawn Newsearlier, LHCBA President Asad Butt had said that the lawyers’ protest would continue until their demands were met. “The police have inflicted cruelty by using force against a peaceful march,” Butt said, noting that dozens of lawyers have been injured by tear gas shelling. He demanded that the notification of the division of courts be withdrawn immediately and that cases filed against lawyers should be dismissed. According to a previous PBC press release, dated May 7, the LHCBA’s joint action committee — comprising a dozen members — had met on Tuesday where it had decided to “welcome” the protest rally announced by the LBA. The PBC had demanded that the notification of “dividing the lawyers under the guise of the unjust division of Model Town courts” be withdrawn and that terror cases against lawyers be squashed. It had further announced a complete strike in all bar associations across Punjab. The Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) strongly condemned the “police high-handedness against the peacefully protesting lawyers” and urged Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa to take suo motu notice of the incident. In a statement, SCBA President Shahzad Shaukat, Secretary Syed Ali Imran and the bar’s executive committee “expressed solidarity with the lawyers and their just stance”. “Numerous lawyers have reportedly sustained serious injuries and many have been unjustly detained,” the statement highlighted. It demanded immediate medical attention for the wounded and the prompt release of the arrested lawyers. The SCBA lawyers also strongly condemned and criticised the “inept handling of this very sensitive matter” by LHC Chief Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan, who, they said, “failed to resolve the issue despite repeated appeals from the Bar”. They highlighted that the lawyers’ arrests were a “clear infringement of the principles of democracy, freedom of expression, and the right to dissent”. “If the police brutality continues unchecked and the lawyers’ just & fair demands remain unmet, this protest will escalate into a nationwide movement, with SCBA spearheading the call for nationwide action,” the Bar’s statement said. Separately, PBC Vice Chairman Riazat Ali Sahar “vehemently condemned the reprehensible police brutality inflicted upon” the lawyers. In a press release, a copy of which is available withDawn.com, Sahar said that lawyers across the country would “stage a complete strike” tomorrow as well as “convene protest meetings, marches and rallies in their respective bar rooms”. Detailing the reasons for the protest, he said the lawyers were “engaged in a peaceful protest against the notification to transfer cases to the ‘Model Town kutchery’ and the unjustified registration of terrorism cases against their fraternity”. Criticising “excessive and unwarranted use of police force against lawyers”, the PBC vice chairman demanded “immediate and decisive action from both the federal and Punjab governments, along with senior police officers, to address the involvement of police officials in this shameful and inhuman act”. He further expressed disappointment towards the LHC chief justice, stating that the failure to resolve the longstanding issue through peaceful negotiation contributed to the situation. Earlier, footage broadcast on television showed a large number of riot personnel and lawyers clashing, with what appeared to be tear gas blanketing GPO Chowk. View this post on Instagram  In apost on Xat around 12:30pm, the Lahore Traffic Police said that a diversion had been placed at High Court Chowk and Istanbul Chowk towards GPO Chowk. It further added that the Cantt deputy superintendent of police was present at the scene along with “additional contingents”.  Speaking toDawn News, Lahore bureau chief Muhammad Bilal said that all gates and roads to the LHC have been shut so that the lawyers could not enter the court. He noted that since the LHCBA had announced the rally beforehand, there was already a heavy police contingent present at the scene with anti-riot forces and water cannons. “While the rally was making its way to the court, it was peaceful. The police began taking action once the lawyers tried to make their way into the court,” the bureau chief said, describing the situation as “pretty tense”. Meanwhile, when asked why the police resorted to shelling at the lawyers, a senior superintendent of police said the protesters had first pelted stones at the police and tried to engage them in a fight. View this post on Instagram  Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said she had directed Inspector General Dr Usman Anwar to “refrain from using force against the lawyers”. “Lawyers must also resolve their matters with LHC amicably. For the safety of the citizens of Lahore, confrontation should be avoided,” she said in a post on X. "

PTI leadership misguided Imran on all issues: Sher Afzal Marwat,https://www.dawn.com/news/1832266/pti-leadership-misguided-imran-on-all-issues-sher-afzal-marwat,Says he will return to party on Imran's release; PTI's Intazar Hussain Panjutha says all decisions post-Imran’s arrest came from party founder himself.,"PTI leader Sher Afzal Khan Marwat alleged on Wednesday that party leaders Omar Ayub Khan and Senator Shibli Faraz misguided former prime minister Imran Khan on all issues. “Imran has been misguided on every matter, there are many such matters which I will bring to light once they (Faraz and Ayub) give their statements,” Marwat said while speaking to the media outside Adiala Jail. Last week, Marwat wasannouncedas the PTI candidate for the chairman of the Public Accounts Comm­ittee (PAC) after a meeting with Imran. However, a party insider toldDawnthat the PTI’s political committee had met in Islamabad on Friday night under its chairman to discuss thenominationwith a majority voting to replace Marwat with Jhang MNA Sheikh Waqas Akram. “This is a conspiracy against me by the PTI establishment,” a bitter and angry-sounding Marwat had said, confirming the report, when approached for comment over the phone. Marwat came to address the media outside Adiala Jail today as MNA Ali Muhammad Khan was concluding his speech. Questioned about the dispute over the PAC’s chairmanship, Ali Muhammad said Marwat was Imran’s follower and he and the party would accept whoever was decided as the nominee by the PTI founder. Ali Muhammad left the scene as Marwat began to address the media. He said that he had himself requested Ali Muhammad to leave since “I might utter some controversial things so don’t stand beside me.” Marwat said he was not allowed to meet Imran in jail a day ago or today, alleging that “Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz did not allow my meeting to take place.” He alleged that Ayub and Faraz had told Imran that the PML-N was not agreeable to Marwat’s appointment as the PAC chairman and that the position would go to someone else. “I found out two days ago that Shibli Faraz told Imran that the Saudi ambassador also raised reservations about my appointment and said relations would not be good in such a case,” Marwat added, saying that it was a “major thing” if the Saudi government allegedly had an issue with his appointment. “I will not create a problem for Khansahibso he should consider me out of the [PAC chairmanship] race. I don’t want chairmanship of a committee where the Saudi government has a demand to not make someone [the chairman].” Marwat claimed that he was responsible for reviving the party when it was a “dead horse and I went to the people from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to Sindh at a time when all these [acting leaders] were hiding in their burrows”. He added that he had discharged the duties given to him by Imran. Marwat alleged he was “targeted” by the party leadership immediately after the general elections, adding that he had also informed Imran about the matter. He said his disrespect was unacceptable to him at any cost. Divulging details of the matter of the PAC chairmanship, he said the issue was “finalised” when Barrister Gohar Ali Khan had announced him as the party nominee for the position but “they called for voting in the political committee”, adding that Imran had made him a member of the political committee despite Ayub’s reservations. Marwat said after voting was carried out, his opponents visited Imran on Tuesday and informed him about the results of the vote by the political committee. He also said that his brother Khalid Latif Khan wasde-notifiedas special assistant to the chief minister for science, technology, and information technology instead of being given the chance to resign. “They alleged that I want to take Imran’s position. If I wanted to take someone’s position then I would have done flattery as they do. I am not one to flatter and am Imran’s soldier.” He alleged that Faraz had argued for the Senate opposition leader position over Barrister Ali Zafar to secure relief in legal cases. Marwat alleged that Faraz and Ayub were appointing people of their choosing to PTI committees to secure their positions. Marwat announced that he would not work alongside the PTI leadership to mark his protest. “I am going today and I will come to this jail when Imran calls me back, and I will come for protest when Imran gives me the responsibility of the protest,” he said, adding that he did not accept the party leadership. He added that he would resign from the National Assembly without any reservations if Imran signalled him to do so. Later, he said on X: “I have spoken my heart today. I would prefer to relax and stay away from media for a couple of days. It is therefore expected that media would respect my request.”  He doubled down on his allegation regarding Faraz being behind the move to strip him as the party nominee for the PAC chairman and reiterated that he was withdrawing from the contest.  Meanwhile, PTI lawyer and focal person  Intazar Hussain Panjutha responded to Marwat without naming him and said that the decisions taken by the party post-Imran’s arrest came from the PTI founder himself. “Everyone stayed back according to Imran’s instructions and everyone stayed hidden and did their work,” he said, adding that a result of that was the PTI’s success in the general elections. “PTI’s success was that this leadership — Shibli Faraz and Omar Ayub — kept the party united and kept the operations running day and night. “They were instructed by Imran that all party members should come out but these two should come out at the end,” he said “To come out or stay hidden was done on Imran’s directions and since August 5 when Khan was arrested till today, every party decision was taken by Imran himself,” Panjutha said. Replying to Marwat’s allegations of Imran being misguided, Panjutha said he was not the only person who met Imran in prison. “Does his family not meet him? Do only Shoaib Shaheen, Shibli Faraz and I meet him?” he asked. Panjutha said that the “May 9 conspiracy” was carried out to destroy the party however the “new conspiracy” was to destroy the party from within through unrest. “I want to clarify one thing, Imran Khan is still running the party […] We have never violated the discipline. Our primary mission is Imran’s party,” Panjutha said. "
Afghanistan rejects claim of its national being involved in Bisham attack,https://www.dawn.com/news/1832259/afghanistan-rejects-claim-of-its-national-being-involved-in-bisham-attack,Enayatullah Khwarazmi terms DG ISPR's claims as “irresponsible and far from reality”.,"The Afghan defence ministry on Wednesday rejected Pakistan’s claim that the plot to kill five Chinese engineers in theBisham attackwas hatched in Afghanistan. Thestatementcomes a day after Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Maj-Gen Ahmed Sharifsaidthat the planning for the attack was done in Afghanistan and the suicide bomber was also its national. “Terrorists and their facilitators were also being controlled from Afghanistan and the suicide bomber was also an Afghan national,” the ISPR DG had stated. He had also listedother terror incidents, including by the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), that he said continued from Afghan soil despite repeated complaints to the neighbour’s rulers.  Five Chinese engineers and their Pakistani driver werekilledin the suicide bombing on March 26 as their bus was attacked in the Bisham city of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Shangla district. They were travelling between Islamabad and a hydroelectric dam construction site in KP’s Dasu. The attack had prompted China todemanda thorough probe into the deadly blast and security for its citizens. In response, Islamabad had announced a swift probe to hold the “perpetrators and accomplices” accountable. After ajoint investigation teamwas formed to probe the incident, action wasorderedagainst five senior police officials. No group has claimed responsibility for the deadly attack on Chinese nationals. In astatementissued today, Afghan defence ministry spokesperson Enayatullah Khwarazmi termed the claims “irresponsible and far from the reality”. He said blaming Afghanistan for such incidents was a “failed attempt to divert attention from the truth”, adding that the killing of Chinese citizens in an area which was “under tight security cover of the Pakistani army shows the weakness of the Pakistani security agencies”. “The Islamic Emirate has assured China on this matter and the country has also understood the fact that Afghans are not involved in such issues,” the spokesman said. He claimed that members of the militant Islamic State group were “entering Afghanistan from Pakistan”. “We have much evidence of Daesh (IS) who came to Afghanistan from the territory of Pakistan, and Pakistan’s territory being used against us for which Pakistan should answer,” Khwarazmi said. He added that Kabul considered the stability and security of Pakistan to be in the interest of Afghanistan and the region and believed in the “brotherhood and good relations between the people of the two nations. Some of the experts believe that public accusations by Pakistani and Afghan officials will further complicate the situation. Former Pakistani Ambassador Ayaz Wazir said a public blame game would increase mistrust and further deteriorate relations. “Both governments should hold a wide range of talks and explore ways for solutions to problems. Pakistan should clearly convey its concerns over the TTP presence in Afghanistan and also pay attention to the concerns of the other side,” Wazir toldDawn.com. Wazir has served as the Pakistan consul general in Afghanistan’s northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif and was part of a negotiation team between the Afghan Taliban and then-opposition leader Ahmad Shah Masoud in the 1990s. He further said that Pakistan should not blame the Afghan government for incidents in Pakistan and focus on security problems. The tit-for-tat verbal response between the two countries’ officials shows the growing mistrust between the two countries despite several channels of communication, including a joint border coordination committee to review security issues."
IHC approves Bushra Bibi’s petition seeking transfer to Adiala Jail,https://www.dawn.com/news/1832233/ihc-approves-bushra-bibis-petition-seeking-transfer-to-adiala-jail,Bushra is being held in her Banigala residence; Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb pronounced the reserved verdict.,"The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday approved the request of former premier Imran Khan’s wife Bushra Bibi seeking her transfer from their Banigala residence— which had been declared a sub-jail — to Adiala Jail, where her husband is currently incarcerated. Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb pronounced the verdict, which had beenreservedlast week. Although Bushra Bibi’s petition had been disposed of last month due to her lawyers failing to appear before the court, a plea was filed the same day seeking its restoration. “She has already been shifted to a female ward of the jail on her own request,” PTI lawyer Intazar Hussain Panjutha toldAFP. The former first lady was taken into custody on January 31 after an Islamabad accountability courtsentencedher and Imran to 14 years in jail in the Toshakhana reference. While the IHC had on April 1suspendedtheir sentences in the Toshakhana reference, she remains in custody in theIddatcase. Imran also remains incarcerated in other cases. Following the Toshakhana verdict, Bushra had arrived at Adiala Jail, where the National Accountability Bureau’s team was already present, to surrender to the authorities. Subsequently, she was taken into custody by the anti-graft watchdog. How­ever, she was moved to her Banigala home after it was declared a sub-jail in a late-night notification. Her shifting to the residence has beenunder discussionfor months as she and her husbanddeniedsubmitting any application to declare the residence a sub-jail. Almost a week after her arrest, Bushra Bibi hadchallengedthe residence’s status as a sub-jail, urging the IHC to let her complete her 14-year sentence in Adiala Jail. In a subsequent hearing, the Adiala Jail administration hadopposed moving her backto the prison, claiming that overcrowding posed security threats for the former first lady.

3 policemen killed in bomb attack in northeastern Afghanistan,https://www.dawn.com/news/1832273/3-policemen-killed-in-bomb-attack-in-northeastern-afghanistan,The targeted convoy was on its way to destroy illegal poppy plants.,"Three policemen were killed and five were wounded on Wednesday when a sticky bomb was detonated next to a security convoy tasked with clearing illegal poppy crops in northeastern Afghanistan, the interior ministry said. The improvised explosive device (IED) was attached to a motorcycle which targeted a convoy of police vehicles in Faizabad, the capital of mountainous Badakhshan province, around 11am local time. “The bomb exploded while the convoy of police forces was on its way to destroy poppy cultivation,” Taliban Interior Ministry spokesman Abdul Mateen Qani posted on X.  The explosion comes days after Taliban security officials and residentsclashedover the violent clearance of poppy crops in two Badakhshan districts, leaving two dead and sparking rare protests. Afghanistan was the largest producer of opium before poppy cultivation wasbanned in a decreeby the Taliban supreme leader in April 2022. Farmers have been encouraged to plant different crops, but none compete with the financial draw of the poppy, leading some to continue discreetly cultivating small plots. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. AnAFPjournalist saw Taliban authorities searching homes and detaining dozens of people near the scene. Images posted on social media, but not immediately verified byAFP, showed a charred motorcycle and a police truck riddled with holes. Eyewitness Aminullah, who did not want to give his full name, said he heard a huge explosion and saw that a convoy of Taliban authorities had been hit.
“Immediately the security forces cleared the area of people,” he toldAFP. The number of bombings and suicide attacks in Afghanistan has fallen since the Taliban ended their insurgency afteroustingthe US-backed government and returning to power in August 2021. However, multiple armed groups, including the militant Islamic State, remain a threat, with regular reports of explosions that go unconfirmed by authorities."
AstraZeneca withdraws Covid vaccine as demand dives,https://www.dawn.com/news/1832257/astrazeneca-withdraws-covid-vaccine-as-demand-dives,"AstraZeneca has admitted that its Covishield vaccine could cause rare side effects, including blood clots and low platelet count.","Anglo-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca on Wednesday said it was withdrawing Covid vaccine Vaxzevria, one of the first produced in the deadly pandemic, citing “commercial reasons” following a slump in demand. “As multiple, variant Covid-19 vaccines have since been developed there is a surplus of available updated vaccines. This has led to a decline in demand for Vaxzevria, which is no longer being manufactured or supplied,” an AstraZeneca spokesperson added in a statement. “We will now work with regulators and our partners to align on a clear path forward to conclude this chapter and significant contribution to the Covid-19 pandemic.” AstraZeneca rapidly developed the successful Covid-19 jab during the coronavirus pandemic which erupted in the first half of 2020. Vaxzevria, developed alongside Oxford University, was at first offered at cost but Astra decided in late 2021 to sell it for profit. But the world pivoted towards mRNA vaccines, particularly the one produced by US drugs giant Pfizer and German peer BioNTech, after rare blood-clot problems with Astra’s jab increased public hesitancy about taking it. Last week, AstraZenecaadmittedthat its Covishield vaccine could cause rare side effects, including blood clots and low platelet count.  Sales collapsed further as global Covid restrictions were fully lifted worldwide and the world emerged from the global health crisis. The AstraZeneca spokesperson said the group had begun the process of taking it off the market in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. The company will work with other regulators globally to start market authorisation withdrawals for the Vaxzevria “where no future commercial demand for the vaccine is expected”.  The spokesperson said that, according to independent estimates, “over 6.5 million lives were saved in the first year of use alone” and more than three billion doses were supplied globally. “We are incredibly proud of the role Vaxzevria played in ending the global pandemic,” the spokesperson said. “Our efforts have been recognised by governments around the world and are widely regarded as being a critical component of ending the global pandemic.”"
PM Shehbaz orders formation of Pakistan Skill Company to train overseas Pakistanis,https://www.dawn.com/news/1832262/pm-shehbaz-orders-formation-of-pakistan-skill-company-to-train-overseas-pakistanis,Calls for a database to catalogue the Pakistani labour force.,"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday ordered the establishment the Pakistan Skill Company and Pakistan Skill Development Fund to unify technical and vocational education countrywide and provide better employment to the country’s workers abroad. The prime minister, chairing a high-level meeting reviewing the matters of the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development and National Vocational and Technical Training Commission (NAVTTC), decided to introduce reforms within both organisations. Shehbaz also ordered the immediate establishment of the Pakistan Skill Development Fund, according to a federal government post on X. The premier said NAVTTC should be further enhanced to provide world-class technical and vocational training to the young workforce abroad. He added that “globally renowned and international certifications should be ensured in all fields”.  The prime minister emphasised the importance of greater cooperation between the federal institutions, adding that the “technical training plan should be implemented in line with international standards”. Similarly, he stressed collaboration between the centre and provinces to elevate the quality of Pakistan’s technical manpower and human resource development. He also called for a coordinated and organised database of Pakistani workers in collaboration with Nadra, NAVTTC and provincial institutions, and the establishment of an integrated system to regulate manpower equipped with world-class professional technical skills. Stressing the need for implementing the technical and vocational training plans, the prime minister also ordered reforms to the licensing regime of companies employing skilled Pakistanis abroad. PM Shehbaz said individuals and companies involved in defrauding the people and inflicting financial losses should be identified. He instructed authorities to ensure meritocracy and transparency in the posting of community welfare attaches in Pakistani missions abroad. The prime minister was briefed about the steps taken by NAVTTC regarding the vocational and technical training of the workforce in Pakistan. He was told that NAVTTC would provide vocational and technical training to 60,000 people in 2024, while the figure would rise to 0.6 million in the next three years following the reforms. The meeting’s participants were told that the exchange of information about employment opportunities and required skills from foreign countries was being ensured and that data on manpower consumption was also being obtained from local industries. They were also told that NAVTTC had made the certification of male and female students from internationally renowned institutes mandatory to maintain international vocational and technical training standards."
India arrests four accused of recruiting for Russian army,https://www.dawn.com/news/1832247/india-arrests-four-accused-of-recruiting-for-russian-army,"“Investigation is continuing against other accused persons who are part of this international network of human traffickers,” CBI says.","Indian authorities have arrested four people accused of “trafficking” Indian citizens to fight for the Russian army in Ukraine. Two years since Russia’s invasionbegan, tens of thousands of its soldiers have been killed in Ukraine and Moscow has been on a global quest for more troops. At least two Indian soldiers have beenkilledin the conflict, with several recruits tellingAFPthey were shipped to the frontlines under false pretenses. A statement published by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) late on Tuesday said four men had been arrested, including one who had worked in Russia as a translator for a network facilitating the recruitment of Indian soldiers. “Investigation is continuing against other accused persons who are part of this international network of human traffickers,” the statement added. The arrests come two months after the investigators conducted raids across 13 locations in India and detained several people for questioning. The CBI said then that it had found at least 35 instances of Indians being sent to Russia. India’s foreign ministry had earlier said it was working tosecure dischargesfor around 20 Indian nationals in the Russian army. Several Indian recruits toldAFPin February that they were lured into joining up by promises of high salaries and Russian passports before being shipped to the frontlines. The soldiers said they had been promised non-combatant roles but were trained to use Kalashnikov assault rifles and other weapons before being sent to Ukraine. Russia’s army held off a much-hyped Ukrainian counter-offensive last year, and it has since made gains on the front lines as Kyiv struggles with ammunition and manpower shortages. India is a longstanding ally of Russia and has shied away from explicit condemnation of the invasion of Ukraine. Unemployment remains high in India despite rapid economic growth and huge numbers seek work abroad each year, including thousands who had sought employment in Israel after labour shortages sparked by its military campaign in Gaza."
Editorial: ECP has been unable to reflect on disasters it has wrought in the entire electoral process,https://www.dawn.com/news/1832154,,"IT is usually best not to presume, but given recent developments, one may tentatively hope that the judiciary has finally woken up to the controversies surrounding the general election. Following a series of widely criticised decisions from the Election Commission of Pakistan — each of which, it seems, distorted or subverted the public mandate — the judiciary has finally checked the electoral body for exercising arbitrary control over the democratic process. A three-member bench of the Supreme Court admitted a petition this Monday against an ECP decision to give various political parties more reserved seats than they were lawfully entitled to,suspendingthedecisiontill further notice. The petition in question was moved by the Sunni Ittehad Council, which has been arguing that the ECP and Peshawar High Court’s denial of its right to a total of 78 reserved seats in various assemblies was unlawful and must, therefore, be reviewed by the apex court. From the interim order issued by the Supreme Court, it appears that the judges who heard the petition were not inclined to agree with the government and the ECP’s logic regarding why the 78 reserved seats denied to the SIC should be allotted to other parties. During proceedings, the court observed that this decision appeared to have distorted the public’s mandate. Since there was no legal precedent or clear justification for the ECP’s decision, it was agreed that the question would require a constitutional interpretation. The matter has consequently been remanded to the apex committee of the Supreme Court for the formation of a larger bench. Till the case is decided, the interim order also, in effect, scuppered any government plans to start tinkering with the Constitution thanks to the two-thirds majority it had secured in the Lower House due to the ECP’s decision. This may be for the best. One of the other big questions at the moment is what is to be made of theSenate electionsheld recently, in which the lawmakers who currently occupy the challenged seats also voted. In case the Supreme Court strikes down the ECP’s decision, would that mean that the Senate election could be challenged on related grounds? This could prove to be a major headache for the government, as it would further undermine its already questionable legitimacy. If such a situation comes to pass, those affected will only have the ECP to blame. The truth is that the entire process — from polls, announcement of results, formation of assemblies and elections to the Senate — has been mishandled. The electoral watchdog has been so busy finding faults in and imposing penalties on one party that it has been unable to reflect on the many disasters it has wrought in the process. It should deal with the consequences itself. Published in Dawn, May 8th, 2024"
Most hated country in the world,https://www.dawn.com/news/1832152/most-hated-country-in-the-world,,"WHATEVER the Americans may have said on record, the past few weeks of the war in Gaza have proved to be quite trying for them. Central among their concerns is the hit that President Joe Biden’s re-election chances have taken as the war drags on. In the opinion polls, American voters do not actually list the war in Gaza as one of their central concerns, with the economy and abortion taking the lead. However, those that tend to complain about the economy in the US feel that the seemingly endless amount of aid flowing to Israel and Ukraine ismoney that should have been spent on improving their own situation at home. Even though the US economy is currently in the lead globally, rents and food prices at home continue to be high, causing many Americans to criticise the Biden administration’s policies. As many know, thecampus protestsand the fact that scores of graduation ceremonies in the US have been cancelled because protesters have vowed to disrupt them have added to the pressure, which the Biden administration has been feeling, to bring the war to an end. Even though the Democrats have stuck to their usual line of promising unconditional support to Israel and even joined the Republican-controlled House in approving $26 billion in military assistance to Israel, there has been discomfort within. Most of this comes from the internal polling done by the Biden campaign, which reveals a generational shift in the US on the issue of Israel. Unlike the Republicans, the Democrats need young voters to turn out in huge numbers if they are to win like they did in 2020. In states like Pennsylvania — a battleground state — it is precisely this group of voters that took Joe Biden to victory last time. Many of these voters were from cities like Philadelphia, which is home to many universities, and where there is an increasing feeling of reluctance to vote for Biden again, given his position on the war in Gaza. While these young people would not be lost to Trump, most would likely just stay home; and if they do, then it would be the end of Biden’s possibilities in Pennsylvania. Israel is America’s spoilt child. It is used to throwing a tantrum on the floor of the toy store if it does not get what it wants. Not too far away from Pennsylvania is Michigan, another battleground state where the Democratic Party needs large numbers of urban voters in places like Dearborn. The large Arab-Muslim population in the state isunlikely to show upfor Biden if the war continues to drag on into November, and the number of Palestinian casualties continues to mount. Attempts by the Democratic Party to engage this population have not produced many positive results, with local groups showing disinterest in visits by high-ranking Democrats given their position on Israel. At the commencement ceremony for the University of Michigan, held last weekend, a huge student walkout, complete with Palestinian flags and keffiyehs, disrupted the proceedings and provided a clear statement of the shape of things to come if matters did not change soon. On one political talk show, Queen Rania of Jordan pointed out that the world simply does not understand how the US can say Israel should not bomb civilians but then continue to provide it with weapons to bomb civilians, or complain about the lack of humanitarian aid and build a pier to provide it but vote down ceasefire resolutions at the UN. It is what everyone outside the US already knows, but reiterating it to a US population reflects some level of awareness that the US will lose even more of its already flailing international reputation if the war continues. None of this promises a good or durable deal. The Israelis have been coddled by access to seemingly bottomless American coffers, and to an obstinate moral immunity for a terribly long time. Listening to the Zionist perspective often reveals their inability to understand how suddenly and decisively American public opinion has changed. Many continue to draw parallels with how Jewish students on various American campuses may ‘feel’, as well as the Holocaust. They are simply not able to see how utterly delusional their perspectives sound when considered against the more than 34,000 dead Palestinians and the horribly suffering and maimed women and children that Americans have been watching for over six months. Jewish intellectuals like the author Marsha Gessen, who compared Gaza to the ghettoes in Poland during the Holocaust, have faced derision from Zionists, but their silencing has been viewed with alarm by everyone else. Israel is America’s spoilt child. It is used to throwing a tantrum on the floor of the toy store if it does not get whatever impractical plaything or ridiculous demand it makes. It is likely to continue with its behaviour beyond an invasion of Rafah just to have the last word and pretend at some imaginary ‘victory’. There are plenty of hardliners in Israel who even imagine themselves and their country as being able to conduct wars without the assistance of the US. It is just one of the many delusions that have led Israel to where it has ended up after inflicting six months of merciless death and destruction on Palestinian civilians. Its international reputation is in the gutter, people all around the world are up in arms at its genocidal bloodlust, and now even the Americans seem uninterested in standing by their rabid child as it continues to demand a perpetual supply of Palestinian blood to satisfy its desires. Israel may be able to stall aceasefire, and try to take the joy of peace away by insistently inflicting pain on what is left of the Gazans in Rafah. But in its pursuit of this, it will achieve nothing other than becoming the most hated country in the world.

Govt must show policy investors it is now fiscally prudent and very serious,https://www.dawn.com/news/1832153,,"WHAT goes up must come down. This truth also applies to economic trends, which exhibit cycles of ups and downs. However, the pace of going up and coming down depends not on gravity, but economic policies. We are now seeing the effects of higher interest rates, which are slowly taking the steam out of inflation in the consumer price index (CPI). Year-on-year inflation has come down from its peak of 38 per cent in May 2023 to 17.3pc in April 2024. How long does it take to contain high inflation and to lower it? If we take high inflation to mean anything higher than 15pc, then the current spell has been persisting for the last 22 months. The bad news is that in our inflation history, we have witnessed CPI inflation persist above 15pc, peaking at 29.3pc, for 28 months straight — from July 1973 to November 1975. Let us hope that this inflation history does not repeat itself in terms of the length of that spell. If we take high inflation to mean anything in the double digits (10pc or higher), then we have experienced a spell of high inflation that lasted for almost 46 consecutive months during 1972-1976. Another episode of inflation pertained to the global financial crisis of 2008. CPI inflation in Pakistan shot up above 10pc in January 2008. After touching a peak of 26.1pc, it started to decline, but stayed over 10pc for 18 consecutive months till June 2009. However, just after five months, inflation again crossed single digits and stayed at higher levels for almost 30 consecutive months till June 2012. These episodes of high inflation show that once inflation starts spiralling, it is not only difficult to bring it down, it also takes a long time to do so. This is one of many reasons that central banks around the world aim at maintaining price stability around a low, single-digit inflation figure. The current pace of sluggish disinflation could have been speeded up had the government shown fiscal prudence or the State Bank increased the policy rate beyond 22pc. However, the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee made the right move in not stifling the economy by killing growth altogether in FY24. Will fiscal prudence continue in the fourth quarter of FY24? Inflation is not the only malaise hurting us. With the onslaught of high inflation, our real GDP declined by 0.2pc in FY23, and is expected to grow around 2pc in FY24. This is a combination of low growth and high inflation known as stagflation. The inflation history cited here was accompanied by high growth of 6.8pc and 7.5pc in FY73 and FY74, respectively. The economic situation is much worse now, perhaps the worst in our history in terms of low growth and high inflation. This combination is playing havoc with the poverty situation. While Pakistan had commendably reduced its poverty rate between 2001 and 2018, this progress has slowed down due to macroeconomic instability, the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, the devastating flood of 2022, and unending political polarisation. The World Bank recently estimated the lower-middle-income poverty rate to be 40.1pc ($3.65 per day at 2017 purchasing power parity) for FY24, which is about the same as the poverty rate in 2018. This means there will be seven million more poor individuals in 2024 compared to 2018. What should be done to bring down inflation further, increase growth, and reduce poverty? Reducing inflation requires both tight monetary and fiscal policies. While the State Bank had been maintaining a tight monetary policy with historic high interest rates, fiscal policy remained lax in terms of high fiscal deficits and government borrowing from commercial banks. Unless the government achieves a surplus in its primary balance, fiscal policy will remain lax. The good news is that under the IMF’s Stand-by Arrangement, the fiscal authorities have shown some prudence, and the first three quarters of FY24 showed a GDP surplus of 1.5pc in the primary balance, while maintaining a fiscal deficit of 2.3pc of GDP. Will fiscal prudence continue in the fourth quarter of FY24? The April to June quarter traditionally shows very high government expenditures and fiscal deficits. In FY23, the fourth quarter alone added 4.1 percentage points to the fiscal deficit, which took the FY23 deficit to 7.7pc of GDP. Similar pressures are likely in the current quarter, which will cause the fiscal deficit to mount further. Will the fiscal excesses of the fourth quarter convert the cumulative primary surplus of the first three quarters to a deficit? There is still some hope that primary accounts will show a surplus, otherwise the likelihood of getting a medium-term IMF facility will be diminished. Any policy missteps will also increase the risk of the resurgence of inflation. Growth promotion requires an increase in investment, both domestic and foreign, as well as an increase in productivity. While there is a lot of talk about attracting foreign investment, there is a dearth of focus on attracting domestic investment. Promoting domestic investment requires, among other factors, lower interest rates, which can only emerge if the inflation trajectory continues to show a downward trend. Therefore, continuing with prudent macroeconomic policies will lead to lower inflation and lower interest rates, which is conducive to higher investment. Both fiscal and monetary prudence will promote domestic savings, necessary for domestic investment. The government has already engaged with the IMF to secure a new medium-term programme that will increase the likelihood of policy prudence, at least for that period. What happens in the current quarter will be crucial for the government and our economy. While we are not in an IMF programme now, the tendency has been to go on a borrowing binge. Repeating this behaviour may cost the government dearly. It must show the foreign investors it has been wooing that it is now fiscally prudent and very serious. It must also show that our policy talk will soon translate into policy walk in the coming days. This will not be easy, as the government will be under a lot of pressure to dole out money to the usual suspects (power-brokers and resource-devouring groups) in our economy this quarter.

"Editorial: From the looks of it, Israel will not rest until the entire Middle East is in flames",https://www.dawn.com/news/1831995,,"RAFAH, the last shelter for Gaza’s hapless people, is about to face the wrath of the Israeli war machine. There had long been talk of Tel Aviv unleashing murderous force on the southern town on the Egyptian border after the devastation of the rest of Gaza. But now, aspeace talksinvolving Hamas, the Israelis, and Arab interlocutors appear to be deadlocked, the Zionist state is set to unleash another round of butchery in order to ‘finish’ Hamas. According to media reports, Israel has ordered civilians in eastern Rafah toevacuate, while Tel Aviv has apparently moved several brigades close to Rafah, which is crammed with around 1.5m people. Israel and the US have disingenuously blamed the Palestinians for the breakdown in truce talks, but it is clear that Tel Aviv was never negotiating in good faith. While Hamas wanted a long-term ceasefire, Israel insisted on a temporary truce to rescue its hostages held in Gaza, and refused to rule out the Rafah offensive. Though voices from around the world — including calls from the UN secretary-general and the EU leadership — have advised Israel not to attack Rafah, no one in Tel Aviv appears to be listening. Meanwhile, the Muslim world’s leadership has played its part by issuing a strongly worded statement following the OIC summit, held over the weekend, in Gambia. As per the Banjul Declaration, the OIC states have called upon “the countries of the world to take action to stop … the genocide committed by the Israeli occupation” in Gaza. Yet the Muslim world’s leaders have done little of substance themselves — even symbolically — to punish Israel for its monstrous crime. Regardless of the economic clout and hydrocarbon riches of many OIC members, Muslim states have not even been able to enforce a trade and energy boycott of Israel and all those that provide it with arms and funds to slaughter the Palestinians. On the other hand, states in faraway Latin America, including Bolivia and Colombia, have snapped ties with Tel Aviv over its murderous campaign. These states, as well as South Africa, have no religious or cultural ties with Palestine, yet have expressed exemplary solidarity with Gaza, while most Muslim states have limited themselves to issuing verbose statements calling for an end to the violence. Seven months into the slaughter, there are no signs of hope. In fact, UN Secretary-General António Guterres has said the Rafah invasion would be the “final nail in the coffin” for humanitarian activities in Gaza. From the looks of it, Israel will not rest until the entire Middle East is in flames. If and when that dark omen comes to pass, the self-professed guardians of the ‘international rules-based order’ will have no one to blame but themselves and their Israeli allies.

"Heeramandi review — is there anything beyond the glitz, glam and fairy dust?",https://images.dawn.com/news/1192424/heeramandi-review-is-there-anything-beyond-the-glitz-glam-and-fairy-dust,,"Within the fabric of Lahore’s walled city lies a historically rich tapestry — stories oftawaifsetched in the sand, reminders of dance against the clink of chooris and renditions of various versions of womanhood. Opulence is probably the first word that comes to mind when thinking of the new Netflix showHeeramandi.Sanjay Leela Bhansaliticks all the aesthetic boxes — the show immediately reels you into a fantastical Mughal rendering of spacious mansions, intricate outfits and dreamy lighting. Past the elaborate and maximalist world-building, I found myself deeply immersed in this world and yet, I wasn’t constantly engaged. I was searching for a story that didn’t fully take flight. This could have been a story that shifted the narrative when we look back at the history of Heeramandi. Of course, creative direction deserves its due, but there were too many things that didn’t work and for an audience looking for a story, it isn’t so easy to be distracted by “oneiric”. Watching the series was meant to be a portal into the past of Heeramandi and yet, it fell short. Of course, historical fiction comes with room for liberties, creative direction, aesthetic shifts and more but at its core, the show lacks storytelling. Initially, the plot geared us for introspection into the lives of thetawaifsof Heeramandi which swerves towards aRam-Leela-level love affair and spirals into aDevdas-style revolution. That’s not to say Bhansali didn’t do a lot right, the women ofHeeramandicarry the narrative (minus our nepo baby Sharmin Segal who plays Alamzeb). Mallikajaan (Manisha Koirala) resides as the Huzoor (Madam) of Shahi Mahal — she would live and die for the women of Heeramandi. She is fierce, unforgiving and relentless; her acting carries the show. Bibojaan (played by Aditi Rao Hydari), Mallikajaan’s daughter, is a rebel passionate about revolution. Her beauty resounds on the screen and while the eyebrow lift is jarring, her character arc is one I could get behind. From her reveredmujrasto her late-night escapades with the revolutionaries, Bibojaan becomes the heroine of this story.  Alamzeb, also Mallikajaan’s daughter, dreams of being a poet and leaving the shackles of her destined future as atawaif. She meets the dreamynawab, Tajdar (Taha Shah Badussha) and falls quickly and deeply for him. Their love story is cruel, dramatic and honestly, a little bit too on-the-nose. She reads him verses laced with a forced Urdu and passion that just didn’t hit the mark. While we do have mentions of Ghalib and Niazi, in a story that was meant to centralise the women of Lahore, we don’t hear of Amrita Pritam or Ismat Chughtai whose works highlight the plight of marginalised women. Then, we have Fareedan (daughter of Rehana, who was murdered by Mallikajaan). Fareedan (Sonakshi Sinha) is ferocious, harsh and out to avenge her mother’s death, destroy Mallika and gain control of Shahi Mahal. Her growth over the episodes was expansive and cultivated into the comraderie that always makes for a happy ending. She rules the screen, her sharp eyebrows and thirst for power awaken the story. Who doesn’t love a good anti-hero? Historically, Heeramandi was a place that taught artistic prowess. Here lies a community of woman who are the bearers of art, dance and music. Here lies a community of women known as the Queens of Lahore — they are the gatekeepers of craft, revered guardians of refined manners and aim to pass down their knowledge. The women were empowered to make their own choices and it was only after the onset of the British Raj whennawabculture was overthrown that Heeramandi became a home for sex workers. It was a crux of cultural heritage, where people came to appreciate and learn the power of dance, music and poetry. “Both the hereditary and newly trained tawa’ifs strategically deployed their shared identity as skilled performers to rise in social status vis-à-vis their power dynamic with the patrons. Apart from their artistic expertise, an essential aspect of their culture was the secret ‘art of nakhra, or pretence’ that they deployed to exploit wealthy patrons.” (Oldenburg, 1990, p. 274). The courtesans were respected and played an integral role in the preservation of the arts. In some artistic circles today, there is still talk of the enrichment that was passed down from the Mughal era (through Heeramandi). And while pieces of this history are entwined in the story, the sad reality is the lack of the raw oppression of these spaces shown inHeeramandi. It almost seems to be glamourised by fairy dust where the oppression never reaches the light — the khalas and aapas and ammis ofHeeramandiare decked in jewels and lavish clothes and the suffering that should have soaked the narrative is overly glamorised.  The perfection that emanates from the walls of Heeramandi is almost uncomfortable. While patrons of art, their destinies are tied to the Nawabs of Lahore. They bring the money, the jewels, the luxury. It’s a tale as old as time — women’s fates controlled by the men around them. While outwardly queens, there is a constant reminder of the misery that walks within each of their souls. The magical realism of the sets and costumes do not make up for the filmy dialogue, melodramatic poetry and lack of plot — these women have stories to tell but they seem chained to a narrative that does not want to tell it. The sounds of theghungrooform an eerie score for the show — a Heeramandi woman adorns herghungrooonce she has had her debut as atawaif. Bhansali highlights the sublime, yet sweeping over the human experience to make it transcendental and evocative acts as an erasure of important stories; the plight of the women of Heeramandi (their pain, their living conditions), the Muslims living in the Subcontinent (their disconnect is confusing) and the language (the poor pronunciation and lack of fluidity of dialogue). In a lot of fiction, the body is used as a metaphor for society. And Bhansali’s period drama is no different. There was room to delve into the body politics of 1940s India and comment on the lives of thetawaifs— the overarching male gaze on one hand, the ability to speak freely of sexuality on another — where does the conversation lead? There is a layered focus on desire within the story and while thetawaifsthemselves have their own desires, we only see the one reflected back to us through the male gaze. During this period, the arts were deeply connected to social class and identity (the courtesans and creators on one hand and the entertained on the other) — a transactional relationship that was steeped in the fabric of society. Music and dance act as tools to create communities and thetawaifsplayed a large role in that — one that must not be brushed over. Music became a part of the social construction of identity at the time and yet the show doesn’t seem to aid that narrative. Maybe Bhansali wanted to create a story that appealed to a greater audience but let’s not forget that women are the backbone of every form of creation. Thetawaifsand their journeys will not be forgotten, no matter the glamour used to doll it up. Every story about a woman is a story of resistance. The end of the series was beautiful and powerful and probably one of the few scenes that left an imprint on me. The closing narration: “Like birds in gilded cages, thesetawaifsknew the value of freedom…But a woman’s struggle never ends” served as the perfect culmination to a series that relied so heavily upon being perfect. And whileHeeramandiexplored a facet of that resistance, it too remained akin to a bird in a gilded cage, never truly showing us the cost of freedom."
Security guard shot outside rapper Drake’s home,https://images.dawn.com/news/1192425/security-guard-shot-outside-rapper-drakes-home,,"Canadian police on Tuesday were investigating a pre-dawn shooting at the home of superstar rapper Drake, whose sprawling property in a tony Toronto neighbourhood remained cordoned off. Police inspector Paul Krawczyk said a security guard at the mansion on The Bridle Path road was taken to hospital with serious injuries sustained from an apparent gunshot wound after suspects in a vehicle opened fire. The shooting, captured on grainy security camera footage that has not been released to the public, happened at 2:09am. The guard was standing outside the gates in front of the residence when the shooting occurred, Krawczyk told reporters. “I cannot confirm if Drake was home at the time the incident occurred, but I can tell you that we are in contact with his team and they are cooperating,” the inspector added. He said the suspects fled in the vehicle, but no descriptions were offered. Police taped off most of the area. Several small orange markers, believed to indicate locations of shell casings, could be seen scattered on the road’s edge in front of the mansion. Originally publishedin Dawn, May 8th, 2024"
"Almost a year since May 9, there will be little serious discussion on how to move forward in a meaningful way",https://www.dawn.com/news/1832002,,"IT has been almost a year since May 9. In the coming days, much will be said and written about this unfortunate day, its significance and tragedy. There will also be heated discussions about the many individuals accused — imprisoned or not — and the unrepentant PTI. But as with much else, there will be little serious discussion on how to move forward in a meaningful way, because honesty is rarely possible in public discussions. And a candid discussion would focus on the relationship between the establishment and the PTI and how this impacts the country. Take the PTI first. Notwithstanding the gloomy predictions about its demise and the quick departures of its stalwarts 12 months ago, the party managed to do well in the elections despite all the odds against it. But now, it seems stuck once again in old and new challenges. Even when in power, the PTI was a noisy organisation with little discipline. In these trying times, this hasn’t changed. With limited access to Imran Khan, the party appears to be a headless chicken. And, as old rivalries are maintained in time-honoured PTI tradition, new entrants such as lawyers and the older lot of politicians are also jostling with each other.  Decision-making has become even more chaotic. Dependent on when party leaders can meet Khan and who talks to the media after meeting him, the decisions at times are the famed ‘U-turns,’ while at others it seems that the entire lot is stuck at a roundabout, unable to locate any exit. Consider the choice of KP finance minister. It seems that the chief minister-designate was able to ignore Khan’s instructions because of his personal discomfort. Or the absoluteconfusionabout who was going to be the party’s choice to head the Public Accounts Committee. For weeks, there was no clarity on whether or not Sher Afzal Khan Marwat, a missile who lands as often on the PTI as it does on its rivals, would be the party’s choice or someone else. The issue was resolved with the party choosing Sheikh Waqas, according toDawn, but after much drama, with little logic. Poor decision-making has been held responsible for the party’s misfortunes rather than its run-ins with the establishment. This may not matter in the long run. What is more critical is the party’s limited choices. Its popularity is now at a point where it can no longer be denied by anyone — but it comes at a cost. Keeping in mind the mood of the electorate, the PTI will lose support if it reaches an understanding with the current set-up or the establishment. (The PML-N’s diminishing support proves this.) But neither can it sustain the stand-off. The establishment faces just as difficult a choice as the PTI. Consider the dynamics in KP, where the initial euphoria is giving way to criticism; Ali Amin Gandapur especially, and the party in general, are being accused by workers of being compromised. This has been particularly true of the government’s silence in the face of the disappearance of a PTI worker in recent days. Indeed, every small ‘instance’ of compromise or inaction is being seen as a sign of betrayal — such is the level of emotion. But without developing a working relationship with the centre or the establishment, how will the party govern? For now, the party has no answers. (Similar pressures are at work in Punjab.) However, this is not just a dilemma for the PTI, but also the establishment, which historically has always engaged with popular forces after confrontation. This happened with the PPP in the 1980s and the PML-N in the noughties. Many argue it won’t be any different this time, though of course the time frame in each of the two cases has been closer to a decade. But that was when the country wasn’t in the midst of an intractable economic crisis — a principal reason why the PTI has become the force it is. Indeed, carrying the burden of an unpopular government as well as the economy is not all that easy for an establishment that has usually been able to lay claim to public support from regions such as Punjab. But this time around, there are no goodies to share to make up for sidelining a popular party; in fact, there is just bad news in the shape of taxes or higher bills. It appears, as the last one year indicates, that the only way to manage such a situation is to use repressive measures on ordinary people, politicians and mainstream and social media.  The problem, however, with an enforced quiet is that it has to be enforced — continuously. Even then, it cannot overcome the lack of legitimacy or support; which is why in the past the establishment has always opted for a ‘reset’ eventually. In other words, the establishment faces just as difficult a choice as the PTI. If nothing changes, the pendulum will continue to swing in Khan’s favour. Consider that before Khan was arrested, there was chatter about how he continued in comfort at the expense of his party and its members. But then, he was arrested and the criticism died down. Now it is worth asking what the price of easing restrictions on Khan will be. Will it be possible to control the public reaction if he is allowed out in public in the near future, even in terms of a simple court appearance? And if there is no ceasefire, how will the establishment manage public anger and expectations, especially as it prepares for the next IMF programme? That there is realisation of this explains the constant pressure for or discussion of how the political parties need to ‘talk’. Doubting Thomases find it hard to believe this stems from the charter of democracy fandom or those who want to cheer on the establishment and the PTI together. A year on, something has to give. Reason demands this, even though it has been in short supply in Pakistan for quite some time. In the process, both the PTI and the establishment will have to pay a price. The writer is a journalist.

Fighting Pakistan’s food crisis,https://aurora.dawn.com/news/1145089/fighting-pakistans-growing-food-insecurity-crisis,,"The year 2023 ended with a climate conference in Dubai to mark the28th convening of the Conference of Parties. The meeting was the first Global Stocktake, after the Paris Agreement of 2015, to assess the state of global climate and its impact on present and future life systems on planet Earth. The vision for a universal and liveable planet is not possible without ensuring a sustainable food production and distribution system that is just, equitable and orderly, as well as affordable and accessible to all. Currently, the world is embroiled in a rolling food crisis where2.4 billionpeople (nearly a third of humanity) are moderately or severely food insecure, with women and girls bearing the brunt, accounting for almost 60% of the hunger-stricken population. Hunger is on the rise, affecting 800 million people worldwide, with challenges to agricultural productivity also increasing. Each day that delays emission reductions means exposing more people to food insecurity. As the planet continues to warm, food systems will come under increasing stress, setting in motion a chain of events that will reinforce a negative feedback loop. Current farming practices are responsible for a third of all greenhouse gases (GHG). They are also responsible for eroding natural resources (water, soil and pollinator populations) and increasing risks from zoonosis and antimicrobial resistance. Meanwhile, family farms and smallholders (608 million globally) receive a fraction of the sector’s profits. Standing at this critical juncture, it is important to put things into perspective and look for solutions that reduce GHG emissions from the agriculture sector and, at the same time, keep production levels adequate to meet people’s dietary needs. This challenge will require an approach that combines healthy, affordable and sustainable diets with systems in place that tackle food waste, restore natural systems, boost investment in ecologically beneficial and regenerative agriculture practices, and include agroecology as an integral part of managing all future food systems. Farmers need to be rewarded more fairly and their skills harnessed to transform food systems. An equitable approach can help improve livelihoods, tackle environmental degradation and provide food security. However, achieving these outcomes requires a massive uplift in investments from the public and private sectors, including smallholder farmers, who receive only1.7%of total global climate finance. The world’s biggest emitters of agricultural methane and users of mineral fertilisers should lead by agreeing to cuts in the amount of methane emitted by their farming systems by 2030 and reducing losses of reaction nitrogen by 50% by the same date. Agriculture is hugely dependent on weather patterns and climatic conditions. Crops that rely heavily on seasonal precipitation, specific temperature ranges and soil conditions will be affected more severely by stark variations and sudden changes in the climate. Similarly, heat-sensitive and water-intensive crops will suffer a setback due to sudden changes in factors that determine the quality and quantity of yield. For Pakistan, the challenge is amplified by many other factors that contribute to the emerging crisis. Each has its unique constraints that need to be addressed separately but simultaneously to avoid a polycrisis. The unsustainable population growth rate of2.55%is the biggest obstacle to food security. It throws a spanner in the attempt to balance supply with demand. In 1981, wheat production in Pakistan was12 million tons, with a population of 84 million. Today, production is28 million tons, but an increase in population by 187% (241 million) has rendered the 133% increase in yield redundant. The rampant use of agricultural land without any agroecological studies to guide practices has resulted in suboptimal productivity and the waste of natural resources. Under the ‘business-as-usual’ scenario, low yields will become lower under a changing climate, with serious implications for food security. As a lower-riparian, single-basin country, Pakistan relies heavily on the flows of the River Indus for irrigated agriculture. The quantity and quality of water are both under increasing threat from global warming. The Indus derives over 40% of its water from snow and glacial melt, making its flow more susceptible to climate change. The abundance of water that results from accelerated melting will result in flooding, while water scarcity will lead to drought and desertification. Both are detrimental to agriculture and will contribute to the food crisis. Mountain communities that rely on melted glacier water for agriculture are already witnessing the impact of changes in the timing and quantity of water. As the phenomenon hits country agriculture, the threat to food security will mount. Reportsby experts, including modelling projections by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, warn of stark changes in the Hindukush, Himalaya and Karakoram mountains. South Asia warming more rapidly than the rest of the world will put 250 million people who rely directly on the Hindukush, Himalaya and Karakoram mountain system at risk and indirectly impact another 1.8 million. In Pakistan, the increase in population and the decrease in water flow will have serious consequences for food production. Agriculture in arid and semi-arid geographies requires very careful planning to ensure that food systems remain sustainable. Pakistan needs to be mindful and plan carefully. The Country Climate and Development Reportsprepared by the World Bank provide a roadmap for transforming the agriculture-food system. The recommendations include delinking agriculture from practices that push water and land resources beyond safe thresholds, causing the degradation of ecosystems across landscapes; managing and equipping irrigation and drainage systems to cope with climate extremes; removing inefficient and inequitable subsidies; improving services essential for increasing productivity – research, extension and the development of markets; and finally, removing impediments such as skewed ownership and tenure insecurity. As we move forward, it is important to connect the dots between food, water and population to create a sustainable model. Maladaptation in agriculture is not a stand-alone issue. It is closely linked to peace, stability and security. The rising cost of food will increase already high rates of stunting in the country, trigger displacements due to climate-induced disasters, result in demographic shifts with enhanced pressure on cities, increase poverty, and create conditions for conflict in society. It is in Pakistan’s interest to take corrective measures before it is too late. The new government has the opportunity to leverage the Special Investment Facilitation Council(SIFC)to reform the agriculture and livestock sectors and make them more robust and resilient. Notwithstanding the challenges faced by the agri food sector, it still presents a strong case for catalysing growth in the rural economy and boosting productivity and exports. With calibrated management and the right mix of policies, partnerships and implementation strategies, the agriculture sector offers Pakistan the best opportunity to achieve its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) for 2030 and develop the macro-fiscal stability it needs to cope with climate shocks.

"‘Met Gala Massacre’ — social media slams fashion’s biggest night, the Met Gala, as Israel invades Rafah",https://images.dawn.com/news/1192421/met-gala-massacre-social-media-slams-fashions-biggest-night-the-met-gala-as-israel-invades-rafah,,"The Met Gala took place in New York City on Monday — if you were unaware, what is often dubbed fashion’s biggest night is a parade of avant-garde fashion worn by A-list Hollywood celebrities. The gala, which attracts mass media attention, is a yearly mammoth fundraiser for the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute. However, this year, the occurrence of the Met Gala — hosted byVogueeditor-in-chief Anna Wintour — was heavily critiqued by netizens because of the worsening situation in Gaza as Israel amps up its aggression. On the first Monday of May, the day that marks the celebration of the gala, Israelcalledon Palestinians to leave eastern Rafah, amid increasing global alarm about the consequences of an Israeli ground invasion of the city. Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Anto­nio Guterres, condemned the order and said it would be “impossible to carry out safely”. Millions of Palestinians lived and were taking refuge in Rafah, however, Tel Aviv has apparentlymovedseveral brigades close to the city. As we watch the massacre of an entire nation from our phones and computers, it is incredibly difficult to celebrate the ‘first Monday of May’ and watch celebrities parade around in outfits worth hundreds of thousands of dollars (which let’s be real, they will only wear once). Meanwhile, in Gaza, threats of famine loom amidst death and destruction. The jarring juxtaposition of the two simultaneously occurring events feels dystopian (to say the least) and is reminiscent ofThe Hunger Games, as several X (formerly Twitter) users pointed out.   People maintained that the dystopian nature of the situation was “excruciating”, especially since pictures of injured children from Gaza were “interspersed” with images of Met Gala fashion online. “Doing the Met Gala at this moment in time feels like how the Germans were still doing big movie premieres in Berlin in 1945,” an X user wrote, referring to the second world war when Hitler’s Nazi Germany persecuted Jewish people.   Others used their platforms to direct attention to the tragedy of Gaza, and called for “all eyes on Rafah”, with one individual emphasising that it was “insane” that some were “fretting over people’s fits”. “I love fun. I love frivolity. I do. But wake up,” they urged.     There was also outrage over the cost of the Met Gala tickets, with each one selling for a whopping $75,000. One individual highlighted that the cost of one ticket could evacuate up to three families from Gaza. “The entire event is a profit-oriented display of privilege and wealth which Isnotreal will probably use to distract from bombing on Rafah,” an X user wrote.   People were also quick to highlight that high-profile events, featuring Hollywood’s elite were often used as a “distraction” to divert attention from Israeli aggression as people’s social media timelines flood with the latest pop-culture happenings. An X user maintained that “Israel always intensifies the bombing when they know the world will be distracted with a major event”.    “The Super Bowl, the Oscars, the Met Gala. They’re relying on you being distracted by terrible rich people parading around doing terrible rich people things while they invade Rafah and massacre thousands,” a netizen wrote, urging people to keep talking about Palestine.  “While you’re distracted by the Met Gala, people in Rafah, the last designated ‘safe zone’ in Palestine, are being murdered by Israel,” another user wrote.  Netizens were also quick to express severe disapproval of the Met Gala, with one individual calling it the “Met Gala Massacre”, indicating that Israel rushed to “mass evacuate Rafah and immediately start bombing” it because the gala served as a distraction. Other users maintained that they found it hard to care about the event “when Israel is actively bombing the last livable place in Gaza”.   “You think your respect for the ‘civilised’ world can’t get any more extinct but then they show you their evil, their callousness, their indifference.”  Celebrities attending the Met Gala also came under fire, with some claiming we live in a “deeply sick society”. Another user said celebrities looked “goofy… posing in their little outfits for the Met Gala”. They maintained that the celebrities’ energy was “clueless, classless and desperate.”   An individual highlighted that the “majority of these celebrities and their designers have shown no spine or remorse to what’s been happening since October 7”.  Some also made comparisons between the coverage received by celebrities on the red carpet and those mourning their deceased loved ones in Gaza. “Nine men tenderly placed Cardi B’s dress on the Met Gala floor. Yet the solitary bodies of infants bombed in Gaza by the US and Israel weigh heavier.”  Another person maintained that a “man carrying a celebrity unable to walk in her tight dress at the Met Gala is getting more coverage than a father carrying his dead child in Rafah”, referring to singer Tyla, who had to be carried up the steps of the museum because she could not move in her dress.  One X user took a kinder approach, as they encouraged people to post “simultaneously” about both Gaza and the Met Gala. “While the met is very fun and exciting, please if you are posting about the Met Gala, please simultaneously post about Gaza and Palestine and everything [that is] happening.”  Meanwhile, pro-Palestine protesters in New York converged near the Met Gala in a rally against the ongoing war in Gaza, leading to several arrests, police said. Among the rallying points were the gates of Columbia University, which has been the centre of spreading demonstrations, before protesters marched through Manhattan to American fashion’s biggest night — or at least as close as police would let them. It was unclear how many arrests were made as stars walked the carpet and posed for photos, butAFPjournalists confirmed several arrests while theNew York Daily Newsreported the number was about a dozen, out of hundreds that gathered near the soiree. Organisers on X posted a flier for an event dubbed the “Citywide Day of Rage for Gaza.” Monday’s protest appeared unconnected to the demonstrations that have rocked Columbia’s campus, culminating in the university calling the police to clear out student protesters. We can’t help but completely agree with all the tweets, it is extremely difficult to turn a blind eye to the suffering of an entire people and focus on what Zendaya and Chris Hemsworth were wearing, or who designed Lana Del Ray’s outfit. All eyes on Rafah. Additional input from AFP"
Modi and MPs from Pakistan,https://www.dawn.com/news/1832001/modi-and-mps-from-pakistan,,"REVANTH Reddy, the waggish Congress chief minister of Telangana, was fielding questions from a BJP-hugging TV anchor about Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s prospects in the ongoing elections. “Do I see myself accepting that Mr Modi is coming back with 400 seats? It’s mathematically not possible, unless he is also counting MPs from Pakistan.” Reddy’s answer reflected his recourse to ready wit, which he uses to stall time-consuming acrimony, particularly one with no political yield. The Lok Sabha has 543 elected seats, and, so far, only Rajiv Gandhi has won 400-plus seats following Indira Gandhi’s assassination in 1984. It’s not unusual for electoral canvassing in India to bring in Pakistan. Mr Modi is a folk hero with his fawning TV anchors for using Pakistan as a peg to hang hisanti-Muslimbias on. In his speeches, which are packed with half-truths and free-flowing communal bile, he concocts quotations from the Congress party’s election manifesto. Congress will take away Hindu women’s mangal sutras, a necklace sacred to married women, to give them to Muslims. The manifesto, he never hesitates to insist with a straight face, is inspired by the Muslim League. What he doesn’t say is that the election commissioners were handpicked by Mr Modi and the favour is returned by their refusal to name him as a violator of election laws that bar communal targeting. India’s election commission was till recently hailed as a role model abroad, and there are countries it helped set up elaborate bodies for running elections. Mr. Modi’s parliament overturned the apex court’s advice to include the chief justice with the leader of the opposition in the three-member selection committee, along with the prime minister, to elect the commissioners. In recent speeches, Mr Modi has curiously stopped claiming 400 seats with allies, with BJP alone securing 370. But his home minister continues to proclaim the tally as a done deal. In election season, making tall claims is normal. The problem comes when the claim is broadcast as gospel truth uncritically on English channels. The foreign media often picks up whatever is available in English, though it is equally true that diligent reporters use translators to scour the vernacular media. Most, however, would still miss the fun the Congress chief minister was having in predicting the prime minister’s fortunes. As Indian elections enter their third phase on Wednesday, Mr Modi is looking rather unsettled, not least by the lower voter turnout. Reddy pulled out a chart from the 2019 polls. He showed clearly that the BJP had saturated its victories in its base in northern states. For example, there are 25 seats all told in Rajasthan, 10 in Haryana, seven in Delhi, five in Uttarakhand, four in Himachal Pradesh, and 26 in Gujarat. The BJP won all the seats, including with allies. Remaining are 11 seats in Chhattisgarh, 14 in Jharkhand, 29 in Madhya Pradesh, 40 in Bihar, 48 in Maharashtra and 80 in Uttar Pradesh. The BJP won 95 per cent in these states, barring Uttar Pradesh, where it got 78pc seats. In the outgoing Lok Sabha, the BJP had 303 MPs, well above the halfway figure of 272. As Revanth Reddy asked, where are the remaining 67 MPs coming from to take the party’s tally to 370? Besides, would the BJP retain everything it has? Very unlikely. As Indian elections enter their third phase on Wednesday, MrModiis looking rather unsettled, not least by the lower voter turnout. Some see it as the trigger for his increasingly divisive speeches. Why do they say Mr Modi looks unsettled? Whether the picture changes in the following four phases, which end with the last round on June1, cannot be predicted. The adamant assumption (or fear) in the foreign media remains that he is primed to win a third term. The facts, as gleaned from the ground reality, look different. The inevitability of his victory today rests on ifs and buts rather than the wave that won him the previous two terms. One has essentially two choices to follow the painfully long elections, in case braving the heatwave singeing the country isn’t an option. One may trust the 24X7 TV channels, which entails accepting the prime minister’s every claim, something the fawning anchors carry unquestioningly to a captive audience deep inside the country. Here, there’s virtually no room for the opposition’s perspective to sneak in. The seemingly more tenable and fleshed-out perspective comes from a bevy of YouTube channels. They have sprung up out of the blue, as if to rein in Mr Modi’s eagerness to declare victory before the race has begun. These internet channels are equally wary of giving needless leeway to the opposition. On a Hindi channel calledPublic India, you would meet battle-scarred journalists from Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and so forth.NewsLaundry.comoffers brilliant insights from battlegrounds in English and Hindi. Being an avid UP person, however, I cannot help relishing the idiomatic banter and Hindi metaphors thrown in steadily, occasionally, with a fragrant paan in the speaker’s mouth. The bespectacled Arun Kumar Sharma is an old insider of the BJP from Delhi. He would tell you analytically why the BJP’s workers on the ground are not giving their best to Mr Modi. The anchor, Anand Vardhan Singh, guides the discussion professionally with a clip here of Mr Modi’s vitriol juxtaposed with a fierier speech by Priyanka Gandhi. Hari Shankar Joshi is respected for his understated insights, Sharat Pradhan is brought in for a deep survey of the battle formations in Uttar Pradesh. There is a growing consensus among these analysts as the elections proceed that Mr Modi might even lose his job to a BJP rival if he doesn’t produce another rabbit from one of his myriad headgears. There is also a view that the BJP will struggle, if help doesn’t arrive soon from Pakistan, a reference to Mr Modi’s tested ability to conjure a real or imaginary stand-off at will.

"Karachi’s diplomatic community, too, faces gas crisis",https://www.dawn.com/news/1831963/karachis-diplomatic-community-too-faces-gas-crisis,,"KARACHI: The gas supply crisis in Karachi has started hitting every segment of the society as a member of the city’s diplomatic community complained of facing the challenge like any other Karachiite. The issue was discussed by Iran’s Consul General in Karachi Hassan Nourian when he shared his experiences of living in the metropolis, saying some nights it was quite challenging to cook a meal. With a smile on his face, the diplomat shared the pain of Karachiites while discussing the energy needs of Pakistan and the recent discussion between the two countries to complete along-delayed gas pipeline project.  Speaking at the Meet the Press programme of the Karachi Press Club on Monday, the Iranian diplomat spoke at length about challenges faced by the two countries, prospects of cooperation between the neighbouring states and the impact of Iranian President Seyyed Ebrahim Raisi’srecent visit to Pakistan. Diplomat Hassan Nourian says Islamabad showing political determination to complete Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project “We [Pakistan and Iran] have already missed the deadline we had set to complete the project,” he said in response to a question. “There are several political and technical reasons behind such delays but at the same time we see political determination from Pakistan to complete the project.” “The Iranian government is very muchwilling to cooperatewith Pakistan and fulfil its energy demand. And I personally know the growing [energy] need of this country. Like all of you, I also live in Karachi and we all know how sometimes it becomes difficult to prepare a meal during night,” he added. He said the pipeline did not come under international restrictions, according to a Reuters report. Islamabad and Tehran had signed an agreement to construct the pipeline in 2010, but work on Pakistan’s portion has been held up due to fears of US sanctions. Iran says it has invested $2 billion to construct the pipeline on its territory. Pakistan, however, did not begin construction, citing international sanctions on Iran as the reason.  In 2014, Islamabad asked for a 10-year extension to build the pipeline, which expires in September this year. Iran can take Pakistan to international court, industry watchers have said. The Iranian diplomat did not answer a question about the potential for Iran to take legal action against Pakistan if it did not complete its side of the pipeline this year, theReutersreport added. ‘Terrorism poses common threat’ Referring to the recent visit of the Iranian president, he said that he had met with Pakistani officials and business leaders and the two countries agreed to expeditiously finalise the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and hold the next sessions of the annual Bilateral Political Consultations (BPC) and Joint Business Trade Committee (JBTC). To a question, the diplomat said that both the countries condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and recognised that it posed a common threat to regional peace and stability and presented a major impediment to the development of the region. “For better coordination and smooth action, Pakistan and Iran have appointed officers in Turbat and Zahedan, respectively, to coordinate and communicate to the high-ups of both the countries regarding any terrorist activity,” he added.

The storytellers of D’land,https://www.dawn.com/news/1832258/the-storytellers-of-dland,"Let's find out what Din Din, Delma and Dazel are up to this week.","“The storytellers are here”, said Dazel as she swooped down on a rock near the glistening silvery lake. “Storytellers?” asked Din Din, his curiosity provoked.  “Yes, there is a band of storytellers who go around D’Land telling the most amazing stories,” replied Dazel. “Wiz Rooster told us about it. They are putting up a show at the lakeside this weekend. I can’t wait!” “Bah! What good are stories?” retorted Din Din. “Just imaginary tales to fill up our heads! Useless!” “No, they are not useless,” cried out Dazel who loved to read fiction. “Stories tell us about the world; about creatures and events of the past; they pass down morals and lessons from generation to generation.” “I agree,” joined in Delma who had just swam up to the lake bank. “Olly the octopus always tells us that stories are a great way to not just relax, but develop imagination and help us cope with our feelings.” “Well, if you guys say so,” said Din Din doubtfully. “We will all watch their performance together this Saturday night. I have got tickets for all three of us. They were being sold at the Aviary School. I bartered them for a whole sack of sunflower seeds and a basketful of berries,” said Dazel in excitement. During the week all everyone could talk about was the storytellers’ performance. “The group consists of a curious combination of creatures,” shared Derek, Din Din’s brother. “They say there is an ostrich, a peacock, nightingales and sparrows and an owl who make up their troupe.” “You are so lucky Dazel has got you tickets for their first show,” remarked Derek enviously. “The Sunday shows are sold out too.” “Don’t worry, Derek. I’ll get tickets for the next weekend,” promised Mr. D, their father. “Don’t forget to get tickets for us too,” urged Grandmamma who loved acting and enjoyed all sorts of performing arts. “Grandmamma, you can go in my place this Saturday,” offered Din Din. “I’m not very eager to go anyways.” “No, no, Din Din, you carry on with your friends. I want you to enjoy yourself,” said Grandmamma shaking her head. “We will all go together next weekend.”
So that Saturday evening, as the sun was beginning to set, Din Din found himself sitting at the lakeside with his best friend Dazel perched on his back and Delma at the water’s edge by his side. There was a large stage erected across the lake’s bank. The audience was seated in a semicircle around it. A large shroud hung on the stage. It seemed to be made of some thin animal skin. The only illumination was the pale light of the moon. Suddenly, the strains of the nightingales’ sweet song and the sparrows tweet filled the air. A flickering light could be seen behind the animal skin curtain. Maybe it was a fire or it could have been a group of fireflies. A gasp resounded in the clearing as a beautiful peacock and an ostrich gracefully walked up on the stage in perfect unison. A hoot was heard and a large owl flew down next to the peacock. “Good evening, my dears. Prepare to be entranced,” announced the owl in his husky, mysterious voice. “Once upon a time…,” began the owl in his haunting, expressive voice. As the story unfolded, the peacock and ostrich mimed the performance, while the nightingales and sparrows provided the musical strains. The tale was a sad one about two creatures who loved each other but were fated not to be together. Din Din was entranced as the words of the storyteller wove a magical web. Around him, the other creatures too were spellbound. Din Din found himself smiling and mourning with the characters as the story proceeded. The last scene was of the ostrich lying on the stage, the peacock keening over him, her glorious feathers fanning shut. Din Din felt his eyes well up with tears. So engrossed was he in the performance that he was oblivious to his surroundings. When the enclosure filled with the sound of applause, he was jolted out of his trance. “So did you enjoy the performance?” asked Dazel as the crowd began to disperse. “You were right, Dazel,” Din Din said. “I never realised that a story could touch our hearts so deeply.” “There were so many emotions: love, betrayal, sorrow, death…everything a living being experiences in their lives,” agreed Delma. “But it was rendered so beautifully. And the way the owl used his words and his voice was spectacular.” “I didn’t want the performance to end,” said Dazel. “Next weekend will be another story. The amazing thing is that they do not repeat a story for more than one weekend.” “My family is going next weekend,” said Din Din. “I wish I could go again.” “I’ve heard that performances for all the weekends of this month are sold out,” said Dazel. “How long is this troupe staying in this part of D’Land?” asked Delma. “They stay for as long as they wish. Sometimes it’s just a week, sometimes its months. I hope they like it here and can stay for months,” prayed Dazel. “So do I,” murmured Din Din. That night as Din Din walked home in the moonlight, the soulful voice of the owl, the song of the nightingales and the graceful dance of the tall birds reverberated in his mind. “How was the Storytellers story?” asked Grandmamma who was waiting up for him. “Oh Grandmamma! It was spectacular!” gushed Din Din. “I have acted in plays thanks to you but I have never been so moved. They are maestros.” Grandmamma smiled, “The performing arts have the ability to melt the most stoic of hearts.” “Will you tell me a story, Grandmamma,” said Din Din and Grandmamma smiled.

Pakistan’s moment of youth,https://www.dawn.com/news/1831567,,"The future of Pakistan — good or bad — will be determined by its young; most especially by those who are between 15 and 29 years of age today. This, of course, is a cliché. But it happens to be a cliché that is quite literally true. Here is why.  Pakistan’s ‘youth bulge’ is palpable. Just over two out of every three Pakistanis today are below the age of 30 and just under one in every three is between 15 and 29 years of age (our definition of youth). What the demographic momentum imbedded in this one statistic implies is that Pakistan is not just a young country, but that it is going to remain young till at least to 2050, possibly longer.  More importantly, my own research suggests that the youth of Pakistan know this and they expect being given the attention and respect this demographic reality demands. Others who have looked at the question have come to similar conclusions. But the fact of the matter is that we do not need statistics to tell us that Pakistan is a young country. You just need to look around you. Any street. Any marketplace. Advertising on your television set. Certainly, on your Twitter feed. Any political jalsa [gathering]. Any office. Even elected officials and unelected political influentials. The generational change is not on its way. It’s here. It’s set. And, most importantly, it’s here to stay. At least for, and probably for more than, the next two decades. With the majority of Pakistan’s population below the age of 30, the young will invariably influence the country’s future trajectory. However, where the youth of today take this country will depend on the choices that today’s policymakers, Pakistani society and the young themselves make. Eos presents an excerpt from an essay by Adil Najam from the book Pakistan: Search for Stability, published by Oxford University Press…  BEING YOUNG IN PAKISTAN In 2017, the Pakistan Human Development Report produced a comprehensive profile of youth in Pakistan, including a wealth of empirical and opinion data on the young, collected from an estimated 130,000 Pakistanis. However, the key question that we, the authors of the report, were most concerned with was “what does it mean to be young in Pakistan?” Not surprisingly, no easy answers were forthcoming. Like so many other places in the world, being young in Pakistan is both exciting and frustrating. The space that the young occupy in Pakistani society is vast and full of possibilities but, in their own words, is often described as crumbling, contested and constrained on the one hand, and uneven, unfair and uncertain on the other. It is a space that is defined by high hopes, but also deep fears. As subsequent research and events have confirmed, to be young in Pakistan is to be highly agitated, and very often angry. Our research does begin pointing out some of the reasons why this is so. For example, if you were to computationally condense the over 60 million young Pakistanis aged between 15 and 29 into a statistically representative one hundred young people, you would find that just 30 of them consider themselves to be functionally literate, 29 would never have gone to school (despite all being 15 or above), only 6 would have 12 or more years of education and just 39 would be employed. More telling, however, are the structural depravations which highlight that the space ‘to be young’ is severely constrained and shrinking. Of the 100, only six would have access to a library, only seven to a sports facility, just 21 to a park. Only three would have ever been to a cinema, only three to a live music performance. Fifty-nine would say that they do not play sports, or only infrequently. One in the 100 would own a car, 12 a motorcycle, 10 a bicycle and 77 would have no means of personal mobility. Each of these depravations becomes even more acute for women, rural youth, and other marginalised groups within the young. And, yet, within this notional 100, we also found a spirit of great national pride, high aspirations, much hope, and tremendous expectations. They were eager to announce, to any who wish to ride the tiger of Pakistan’s youth, to never forget that this is a generation that demands and deserves better. They are politically excited, excitable and astute. While only 24 percent said (in 2016) that they trusted political leaders, 90 percent of young men and 55 percent of young women claimed that they would vote in the next elections. Of every 100, 48 believe that Pakistan’s future will be bright — although 36 fear it will be bleak. Most tellingly, 67 [of the 100] believe that their lives are and should be better than their parents, only 15 expect themselves to be worse-off than their parents; 89 say they feel happy; 70 say they feel safe. All of them demand the space and conditions in which they can achieve their aspirations. In short, the world of young Pakistanis is as diverse, as differentiated, and as divided as the rest of Pakistan. However, they also have greater expectations and aspirations which, if nurtured, could yield high dividends. Much more telling, however, is the palpable impatience and restlessness which, if ignored, could result in disaster. There are three things to keep in mind as we think about youth anywhere in the world, but certainly in the context of Pakistan. First, and most importantly, youth is a defining category. The reason to think of the young as a category is not just because they are so many, but because — even if they were not this many — the 15-29 year age bracket is where ‘citizenship’ matures. Second, youth is fleeting. Analytically, too, youth is a transitory and dynamic category. Because changes happen fast and furious when one is young, the definition of youth identity and what it stands for can change rapidly, even whilst within that category. Those turning 15 or 16 today can find themselves very distant from those turning 28 or 29 and will very likely not easily recognise the passions of those who would be 16 by the time they turn 28. This may well be true for other categories too but is consequential here, because the short window of this category and the rapid changes within it make notions of what “youth believe”,  “youth stand for”,  and “youth want”, or even ideas of the “youth vote”, are much more transitory and contestable than many analysts assume, and do compound the challenges of youth representation. Finally, youth — especially in Pakistan — is an extremely diverse category. At one level, any category of well over 60 million individuals cannot possibly be homogenous and would demand an investigation into its internal contradictions. But, much more than that, each of the major cleavages that exist in Pakistani society are compounded in its young: gender, class, rural-urban, wealth, technology, ethnicities, religiosity and sectarianism, and geography.  PAKISTAN AND ITS YOUNG: THREE PROPOSITIONS Building and extending on the available research, let us review three key propositions — political, societal and developmental — on how the young of Pakistan might influence the future trajectories of the country’s society and politics. These propositions are offered not as predictions or scenarios, but as choice points. Embedded within each proposition are levers of possible change — where the youth of today take this country will very much depend on the choices that policymakers, Pakistani society and the young themselves make on each of these dimensions. Proposition 1: The young of today are defining tomorrow’s politics, but not always in ways we imagine On the face of it, the bold sounds, sights, language, and even substance of Pakistan politics today seems driven by the young. Even where mainstream political parties are still led by septuagenarians, they wrap themselves in the emblems of youth; political rallies of all parties, even religious ones, feel like high-intensity concerts; political communication is not only geared towards the young but most often crafted by them. On the one hand, this is not entirely new, nor surprising. On the other, however, there is something palpably different, as if what would have been ‘regular’ youthfulness is now on steroids. There is significant reason to believe why it is, and will remain, so. At a basic demographic level, all political actors realise how the maths works: the young are the single largest bloc of new and impressionable voters in Pakistan and there is a long-term and steady supply of them. The demography described in the Pakistan National Human Development Report suggests that every election in Pakistan between now and around 2050 will be defined by the youth vote — including, of course, by their choice to vote or not. Notwithstanding the dichotomy of young Pakistanis claiming high intent to vote and a history of not having done so in the past, the number of young entrants into the voting mix means that, mostly within two election cycles, today’s new voter would be about to — or would already have — enter(ed) a burgeoning 30-49 years middle-age category historically the most reliable and loyal voting group in Pakistan. The political logic of investing in the young voter is impeccable. But demography alone does not explain the dominance of the youth voice in Pakistani politics today. Technology seems to have played an even more defining role; a role that is likely to be as enduring. That the rise of ‘new’ (especially social) media would trigger a steep decline of the ‘old’ (particularly print) media was probably inevitable, but the ‘control’ younger political operatives now exert over social media in all political groupings is remarkable and is now driving significant parts of the political narratives in the country. Of course, certain leaders and parties have capitalised more on courting the youth vote than others and have been differently successful in it. This matters, but mostly in ways that it has always mattered. One should not expect permanence in youth loyalties, not least because it remains a dynamic and diverse category.  It remains to be seen if the current and emerging youth bulge will practically change ballot box behaviour, but conditions are certainly ripe to create the possibility. Finally, a very remarkable feature of Pakistan’s emergent political discourse is how explicit mention of youth issues is nearly absent from political narratives. This, despite the feverish pitch of the political discourse, despite the active participation of the young in this discourse, and even despite the role the young are clearly playing in shaping the narratives. A possible explanation for this anomaly could be that politically active youth in Pakistan have convinced themselves that the pathway to material benefits for themselves — particularly, for example, in the area of employment and improved living conditions — lies through the choice of political leadership rather than of policy.  Proposition 2: Give the young the ability to be young or expect a Pakistan tomorrow that is as divided as it is today The idea that we are denying the young in Pakistan the space to be young is a major finding of the Pakistan National Human Development Report. But it is a thought that first hit me like a ton of bricks in December 2014, as I visited the New Muslim College in Charsadda — just days after the horrific terrorist attack at the Army Public School (APS) in Peshawar — to hold a focus group discussion with 15-18-year-olds on what young Pakistanis were thinking. It struck me that the young men with me in the room were not much older than the students who had died at APS just a few days ago, or those who had done the horrific killing. The reality of the APS attack hung heavy in the room and I realised, as did they, that it is the young in Pakistan who have had to do much of the dying in the so-called ‘War on Terror.’ But there was also a palpably steely resolve in the room. Here is what I wrote about that encounter: “Unlike every other APS conversation I had been hearing — on television, on social media, from politicians, in drawing rooms — theirs was devoid of sloganeering. There was no sign of despair. No hollow display of anger or anguish. No camouflaging of fear with bravado. Instead, there was resolve. Very endearing. Very becoming. Very mature. A very matter-of-fact recognition that this was the reality of the Pakistan they had inherited. A reality they now have to live with…” It is then that I fully realised the perils of being young in Pakistan. “Extremists are out to indoctrinate the young. Terrorists are out to kill them. Educational institutions can neither guarantee quality education nor physical security. An emergent politics of anger uses the passions of the young as fuel for petty politicking. The result is that the space for the young to be young has shrunk — is endangered.” My research has convinced me that the best gift that Pakistan can give to its young is to return to them the ability to be young. Indeed, it may be the best gift Pakistan can give itself — a future where this ability continues to be denied cannot be good for any Pakistani. Being young is not just about being carefree, it is also about being able to explore. In the shrinking space to be able to do so, the young in Pakistan have already inherited most of the societal divides that define the country as a whole. That as many young Pakistanis consider being a Pakistani as their primary identity as consider their religion to be their primary identity, is probably reflective of society as a whole. But what was the most disturbing aspect of our research was that more than 40 percent young men and 50 percent young women disapproved of having friendly relations with someone from another religion, or even another sect; nearly three out of every four young Pakistanis (men and women) responded that they would disapprove of someone from a different religion or sect preaching their religion. The distrust that defines Pakistani society as a whole is equally prevalent amongst the young.  Just over 20 percent said they trusted politicians, only around 25 percent trust the police, just 40 percent had trust in the judiciary and less than 50 percent in the media. All of this was in 2016, and there is enough reason to believe that trust amongst the young has only eroded further since then. Such a snapshot should be read not just as what the youth of today think, but what the Pakistan of tomorrow is likely to think. The challenges of social division, societal distrust and mutual intolerance are clearly great, but solutions are available. Silly as it may sound to some, given the enormity of the challenges, the very first — and possibly most meaningful, although not always easy — step should be resolute policy in allowing the young to be young. Sports grounds are not a big investment, but they can be more meaningful than we might think. It is remarkable how parochial we have become, and simple steps to enhance mobility for the young, including the ability for travel exchange within the country to get to meet other Pakistanis who may not look like us but are equally Pakistanis, is another small but possibly impactful investment. Safe and affordable mobility (along with reliable childcare and clean bathrooms) for young women, in fact, emerges as amongst the most effective means of significantly increasing women’s participation in the workforce. Obvious as it should be by now, it is worth noting that, as we think about youth as a category for social analysis, now and into the future, the simple dichotomy of ‘young vs old’ is not only un-useful but can also be dangerous. In society, as in politics, some of the greatest and most alienating divisions that exist in Pakistan exist amongst the young themselves. The policy challenge is to find ways to reduce these divisions now before they sink deep roots and are passed on to the future, and to future generations. The goal is not empty slogans of ‘integration’, but investing in practical means for the young in Pakistan to interact with other young people in Pakistan. Across divisions of gender, class, geography, religion and rural-urban-metropolitan, the bridges that need to be built are not just of concrete but of conversation.  Proposition 3: ‘Boom or bust?’ — it’s a choice We began the 2017 Pakistan National Human Development Report with a story that is not from Pakistan. It remains valid and is worth repeating here: “On December 17, 2010, a 26-year-old fruit and vegetable vendor in a small town in Tunisia set himself on fire, following a confrontation with a municipal official about where his cart was parked. While the specifics of what led to Mohamed Bouazizi’s death are unclear, what is indisputable is his fatal self-immolation catalysed protests that toppled Tunisia’s dictator and led to a string of uprisings in the region that came to be called the Arab Spring. “The aim of mentioning this situation here is not to recount what happened in Tunis that day, or in the other countries of the Arab Spring subsequently. [Our concern is] with Pakistan’s youth. So, fast forward to Pakistan. “Can you imagine a situation, anywhere in Pakistan, where a young person feels so frustrated by unemployment, or so disheartened, un-empowered and marginalised, that he takes a measure as extreme as Bouazizi did in Tunisia? One certainly hopes not. But hope alone is not enough. It is the responsibility of the state as well as society to enable an environment for our youth where such a fate is not even imaginable. Not even in our worst nightmares.” Trying to predict whether Pakistan’s demographic youth momentum will end up being a ‘boom’ or a ‘bust’ is a fool’s errand. That Pakistan today has the largest number of young people it has ever had and that this number is set to grow over the next multiple decades, is a fact. How this fact will play out is not a matter of reading tea leaves, it is a matter of policy choice. There is the inherent potential of a ‘boom’ in every youth bulge. A large number of new young entrants into the economy can become motors of consumption, generators of ideas and innovation and harbingers of new social energy. There is also the equally inherent potential of a ‘bust’ in every youth bulge. A large number of new entrants into the economy need new employment, can feel suffocated by the lack of room to grow, and can burn with anger when existing systems they wish for are not enabled to change. Certainly not as simple as it may sound, but the final path taken does depend on the choices made by policy, by society, and by the young themselves.

IHC larger bench likely on drive against Justice Sattar,https://www.dawn.com/news/1831986/ihc-larger-bench-likely-on-drive-against-justice-sattar,Bench to take up matter today.,"ISLAMABAD: Islama­bad High Court Chief Justice Aamer Farooq would likely form a larger bench to initiate contempt proceedings on the social media campaign targeting Justice Babar Sattar. The bench would take up the matter on Tuesday (today). According to the sources, Justice Sattar had requested CJ Farooq forcontempt proceedingsafter personal details of his and his family, including their US residence permits, were posted online. Justice Sattar pointed out that the privacy of his family members was breached, and their identity cards and permanent residency card were uploaded to social media. On Sunday, IHC’s public relations office issued a statement in response to the social media campaign, calling it “false, malicious and contemptuous”. The press release stated that the judge was also accused of hiding assets in both Pakistan and the US. “Justice Babar Sattar has never had any nationality other than that of Pakistan,” the IHC clarified, adding that while Justice Sattar worked as a lawyer in New York and was granted a green card, “he left his job in the US in 2005 and returned to Pakistan and has lived and worked in Pakistan since then”. Justice Sattar is one of the six IHC judges who have complained ofinterference in judicial affairsby the country’s intelligence apparatus. Published in Dawn, May 7th, 2024"
India BJP’s election videos targeting Muslims and opposition spark outrage,https://www.dawn.com/news/1831862/india-bjps-election-videos-targeting-muslims-and-opposition-spark-outrage,"Election commission warns parties against misuse of AI tools to create deep fakes, tells them not to publish and circulate such videos.","Animated videos shared by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party targeting the opposition Congress and the Muslim community have evoked complaints and outrage, as the political climate in India heats up midway through its six-week longelection.  Thevideos, shared by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on social media platforms Instagram and X over the last ten days, depict the Congress giving disproportionate benefits to India’s minority Muslim community, at the cost of certain disadvantaged tribal and Hindu caste groups. The Congress, in a complaint to the poll watchdog Election Commission, said on Sunday that the video was shared “clearly with an intention to wantonly provocate rioting and promote enmity between different religions”. A set of guidelines mutually adopted by political parties for how they should conduct themselves during the election period prohibits them from creating “mutual hatred” between caste, religious or linguistic groups. Manipulated videoson social media have also become a contentious issue in this election, such as fake videos showing top Bollywood stars criticising the prime minister. On Monday, the commission warned parties against the misuse of AI tools to create deep fakes and told them not to publish and circulate such videos. It also said parties had been directed to remove such content within three hours of it being brought to their notice. Modi, the face of the Hindu-nationalist BJP, seeking arare third consecutive term, had focused his campaign largely on his government’s performance on economic growth and welfare benefits. But he changed tack after the first phase of voting on April 19 and his campaign speeches have since becomemore polarisingon religious lines, accusing Congress of planning to redistribute the wealth of the majority Hindus among minority Muslims, who he called “infiltrators” who have “more children”. The videos shared by the BJP over the last ten days, one of which has since been taken down, illustrated the same message. A 17-second video shared by a state unit of BJP on May 4, with over 8.5 million views, shows a character resembling Congress leader Rahul Gandhi feeding “funds” to a bird in a skullcap, which eventually pushes out from their common nest three other birds representing other disadvantaged groups. The Congress has filed a police complaint against BJP leaders for the video, BJP’s head of information and technology Amit Malviyasaidon X. “The Congress should in fact thank the BJP for taking their manifesto to the people in a manner that even they couldnt,” he wrote. The video has elicited outrage. Nitasha Kaul, a politics professor at London’s Westminster University said on X that the video was a “straightforward 1930s Germany style cartoon”.  Congress, in its election manifesto, has promised to tackle India’s economic inequality by conducting a socio-economic caste census and extending affirmative action. It said it will ensure that minorities receive “their fair share” of education, economic and healthcare opportunities. An Election Commission spokesperson, the BJP’s Malviya and Congress spokespersons did not respond to requests seeking comment."
Former Karachi street ‘hustler’ and FBI agent released from Florida jail,https://www.dawn.com/news/1831970/former-karachi-street-hustler-and-fbi-agent-released-from-florida-jail,New York federal judge reduces Kam­ran Faridi's sentence from 84 months of imprisonment to 72 months.,"WASHINGTON: Kam­ran Faridi, a former high-profile agent of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), has been released from a Florida prison after serving nearly four years of his 84-month sentence. On Dec 9, 2022, Faridi was sentenced to 84 months of imprisonment on his convictions for “transmitting threats in interstate commerce, threatening to assault a federal officer, and obstruction of justice.” On March 18, 2024, a New York federal judge, Cathy Seibel, reduced the sentence of the Pakistani-origin FBI agent and informant to 72 months. Faridi was recently released on several conditions, including surrendering his US citizenship and agreeing to leave the United States permanently before August. Faridi, now 60, grew up in Block 3, Gulshan-i-Iqbal, Karachi. He was affiliated with the Peoples Students Federation (PSF) and was a close associate of PSF leader Najeeb Ahmed, who was assassinated in 1990. The London-basedMiddle East Eye(MEE) news magazine describes Faridi as a ‘Karachi street hustler’ whose family sent him to Sweden after he was found involved in several violent acts. Faridi migrated to the US in 1991, and within four years, he purchased a gas station in Atlanta, Georgia. There he met some FBI agents who were impressed with his proficiency in Urdu, Pun­jabi, Hindi, and Spanish. In 1996, they formally recruited him as a full-time informant and agent. “A Pakistani-American dual national, Faridi had travelled into opposition-held Syria at the height of the country’s civil war. He talked of building an orphanage there,” the report added. Faridi’s journey from a street hustler to FBI agent ended soon after he played a pivotal role in thearrestof a Karachi businessman Jabir Motiwala in London in 2018. He orchestrated a plot, posing as a Russian mafia operative, to ensnare Motiwala in illegal activities. However, a rift developed between Faridi and his FBI handlers when he threatened to expose their manipulation of evidence against Motiwala. Intent on testifying on Motiwala’s favour, Faridi was arrested in London in 2020 after the FBI intercepted his conversations with Motiwala’s lawyers. Charged with threatening former FBI colleagues, Faridi was swiftly extradited back to the US. Published in Dawn, May 7th, 2024"
Nawaz opts for deliberation amid wheat crisis probe,https://www.dawn.com/news/1831985/nawaz-opts-for-deliberation-amid-wheat-crisis-probe,Decision made to let PM Shehbaz handle the matter.,"LAHORE: PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif, who had intervened in the government’s handling of the wheat crisis, on Monday chose not to ‘go fast’ and let his younger brother Shehbaz Sharif handle the matter in the wake of the ongoing investigation into the megawheat import scam, sources privy to the development toldDawn. “The elder Sharif has decided not to give any kind of instruction to the federal or thePunjab governmentregarding the wheat import scam and let the inquiry committee conclude its probe. Once the investigation is completed, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will involve his elder brother in future actions based on its findings,” the sources said. On Monday, Nawaz Sharif also presided over a party meeting attended by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, federal ministers Azam Nazir Tarar and Ahsan Iqbal, Punjab chapter president Rana Sanaullah, and aspirant of the party secretary general office Khawaja Saad Rafique. However, no discussion was made on the wheat scam during the meeting. Decision made to let PM Shehbaz handle the matter The federal government appears reluctant to thoroughly investigate the mega scam and take action against those at the helm at the time of the import. At present, a fact-finding committee — formed earlier last week to identify irregularities in the import — is led by Cabinet Secretary Kamran Ali Afzal. The committee is tasked with probing the matter and assigning responsibility. The report is likely to be submitted before the cabinet this week. The incumbent government has blamed the caretaker setup of Anwarul Haq Kakar for the wheat import scam. Party president In the meeting, the participants discussed arrangements to elect Nawaz Sharif as president of the PML-N. A party general council meeting scheduled for May 11 was finalised for this purpose. Mr Nawaz will take over theparty presidencyfrom Mr Shehbaz, six years after the Supreme Courtdisqualifiedthe elder Sharif from holding the post. “Nawaz Sharif was disqualified in 2017 [by the Supreme Court] through a conspiracy. Now it’s time that he assumes the office of the party president and leads the party to new heights of popularity,” the party said. The sources said Mr Nawaz would further assert himself in the party after assuming the office of the president. “Law minister Tarar also briefed the meeting about the Supreme Court’s suspension of the Peshawar High Court’s verdict denying the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) — the new home for PTI lawmakers-elect — reserved seats for women and minorities. There had been a sense of worry in the meeting over the SC decision,” the sources said. When contacted, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari told Dawn that Mr Nawaz held a meeting on Monday regarding the preparations for the election of the party president. “No other issue was discussed in the meeting,” she said.

Our sluggish disinflation,https://www.dawn.com/news/1832153/our-sluggish-disinflation,Will fiscal prudence continue in the fourth quarter of FY24?,"WHAT goes up must come down. This truth also applies to economic trends, which exhibit cycles of ups and downs. However, the pace of going up and coming down depends not on gravity, but economic policies. We are now seeing the effects of higher interest rates, which are slowly taking the steam out of inflation in the consumer price index (CPI). Year-on-year inflation has come down from its peak of 38 per cent in May 2023 to 17.3pc in April 2024. How long does it take to contain high inflation and to lower it? If we take high inflation to mean anything higher than 15pc, then the current spell has been persisting for the last 22 months. The bad news is that in our inflation history, we have witnessed CPI inflation persist above 15pc, peaking at 29.3pc, for 28 months straight — from July 1973 to November 1975. Let us hope that this inflation history does not repeat itself in terms of the length of that spell. If we take high inflation to mean anything in the double digits (10pc or higher), then we have experienced a spell of high inflation that lasted for almost 46 consecutive months during 1972-1976. Another episode of inflation pertained to the global financial crisis of 2008. CPI inflation in Pakistan shot up above 10pc in January 2008. After touching a peak of 26.1pc, it started to decline, but stayed over 10pc for 18 consecutive months till June 2009. However, just after five months, inflation again crossed single digits and stayed at higher levels for almost 30 consecutive months till June 2012. These episodes of high inflation show that once inflation starts spiralling, it is not only difficult to bring it down, it also takes a long time to do so. This is one of many reasons that central banks around the world aim at maintaining price stability around a low, single-digit inflation figure. The current pace of sluggish disinflation could have been speeded up had the government shown fiscal prudence or the State Bank increased the policy rate beyond 22pc. However, the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee made the right move in not stifling the economy by killing growth altogether in FY24. Will fiscal prudence continue in the fourth quarter of FY24? Inflation is not the only malaise hurting us. With the onslaught of high inflation, our real GDP declined by 0.2pc in FY23, and is expected to grow around 2pc in FY24. This is a combination of low growth and high inflation known as stagflation. The inflation history cited here was accompanied by high growth of 6.8pc and 7.5pc in FY73 and FY74, respectively. The economic situation is much worse now, perhaps the worst in our history in terms of low growth and high inflation. This combination is playing havoc with the poverty situation. While Pakistan had commendably reduced its poverty rate between 2001 and 2018, this progress has slowed down due to macroeconomic instability, the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, the devastating flood of 2022, and unending political polarisation. The World Bank recently estimated the lower-middle-income poverty rate to be 40.1pc ($3.65 per day at 2017 purchasing power parity) for FY24, which is about the same as the poverty rate in 2018. This means there will be seven million more poor individuals in 2024 compared to 2018. What should be done to bring down inflation further, increase growth, and reduce poverty? Reducing inflation requires both tight monetary and fiscal policies. While the State Bank had been maintaining a tight monetary policy with historic high interest rates, fiscal policy remained lax in terms of high fiscal deficits and government borrowing from commercial banks. Unless the government achieves a surplus in its primary balance, fiscal policy will remain lax. The good news is that under the IMF’s Stand-by Arrangement, the fiscal authorities have shown some prudence, and the first three quarters of FY24 showed a GDP surplus of 1.5pc in the primary balance, while maintaining a fiscal deficit of 2.3pc of GDP. Will fiscal prudence continue in the fourth quarter of FY24? The April to June quarter traditionally shows very high government expenditures and fiscal deficits. In FY23, the fourth quarter alone added 4.1 percentage points to the fiscal deficit, which took the FY23 deficit to 7.7pc of GDP. Similar pressures are likely in the current quarter, which will cause the fiscal deficit to mount further. Will the fiscal excesses of the fourth quarter convert the cumulative primary surplus of the first three quarters to a deficit? There is still some hope that primary accounts will show a surplus, otherwise the likelihood of getting a medium-term IMF facility will be diminished. Any policy missteps will also increase the risk of the resurgence of inflation. Growth promotion requires an increase in investment, both domestic and foreign, as well as an increase in productivity. While there is a lot of talk about attracting foreign investment, there is a dearth of focus on attracting domestic investment. Promoting domestic investment requires, among other factors, lower interest rates, which can only emerge if the inflation trajectory continues to show a downward trend. Therefore, continuing with prudent macroeconomic policies will lead to lower inflation and lower interest rates, which is conducive to higher investment. Both fiscal and monetary prudence will promote domestic savings, necessary for domestic investment. The government has already engaged with the IMF to secure a new medium-term programme that will increase the likelihood of policy prudence, at least for that period. What happens in the current quarter will be crucial for the government and our economy. While we are not in an IMF programme now, the tendency has been to go on a borrowing binge. Repeating this behaviour may cost the government dearly. It must show the foreign investors it has been wooing that it is now fiscally prudent and very serious. It must also show that our policy talk will soon translate into policy walk in the coming days. This will not be easy, as the government will be under a lot of pressure to dole out money to the usual suspects (power-brokers and resource-devouring groups) in our economy this quarter.

Most hated country in the world,https://www.dawn.com/news/1832152/most-hated-country-in-the-world,,"WHATEVER the Americans may have said on record, the past few weeks of the war in Gaza have proved to be quite trying for them. Central among their concerns is the hit that President Joe Biden’s re-election chances have taken as the war drags on. In the opinion polls, American voters do not actually list the war in Gaza as one of their central concerns, with the economy and abortion taking the lead. However, those that tend to complain about the economy in the US feel that the seemingly endless amount of aid flowing to Israel and Ukraine ismoney that should have been spent on improving their own situation at home. Even though the US economy is currently in the lead globally, rents and food prices at home continue to be high, causing many Americans to criticise the Biden administration’s policies. As many know, thecampus protestsand the fact that scores of graduation ceremonies in the US have been cancelled because protesters have vowed to disrupt them have added to the pressure, which the Biden administration has been feeling, to bring the war to an end. Even though the Democrats have stuck to their usual line of promising unconditional support to Israel and even joined the Republican-controlled House in approving $26 billion in military assistance to Israel, there has been discomfort within. Most of this comes from the internal polling done by the Biden campaign, which reveals a generational shift in the US on the issue of Israel. Unlike the Republicans, the Democrats need young voters to turn out in huge numbers if they are to win like they did in 2020. In states like Pennsylvania — a battleground state — it is precisely this group of voters that took Joe Biden to victory last time. Many of these voters were from cities like Philadelphia, which is home to many universities, and where there is an increasing feeling of reluctance to vote for Biden again, given his position on the war in Gaza. While these young people would not be lost to Trump, most would likely just stay home; and if they do, then it would be the end of Biden’s possibilities in Pennsylvania. Israel is America’s spoilt child. It is used to throwing a tantrum on the floor of the toy store if it does not get what it wants. Not too far away from Pennsylvania is Michigan, another battleground state where the Democratic Party needs large numbers of urban voters in places like Dearborn. The large Arab-Muslim population in the state isunlikely to show upfor Biden if the war continues to drag on into November, and the number of Palestinian casualties continues to mount. Attempts by the Democratic Party to engage this population have not produced many positive results, with local groups showing disinterest in visits by high-ranking Democrats given their position on Israel. At the commencement ceremony for the University of Michigan, held last weekend, a huge student walkout, complete with Palestinian flags and keffiyehs, disrupted the proceedings and provided a clear statement of the shape of things to come if matters did not change soon. On one political talk show, Queen Rania of Jordan pointed out that the world simply does not understand how the US can say Israel should not bomb civilians but then continue to provide it with weapons to bomb civilians, or complain about the lack of humanitarian aid and build a pier to provide it but vote down ceasefire resolutions at the UN. It is what everyone outside the US already knows, but reiterating it to a US population reflects some level of awareness that the US will lose even more of its already flailing international reputation if the war continues. None of this promises a good or durable deal. The Israelis have been coddled by access to seemingly bottomless American coffers, and to an obstinate moral immunity for a terribly long time. Listening to the Zionist perspective often reveals their inability to understand how suddenly and decisively American public opinion has changed. Many continue to draw parallels with how Jewish students on various American campuses may ‘feel’, as well as the Holocaust. They are simply not able to see how utterly delusional their perspectives sound when considered against the more than 34,000 dead Palestinians and the horribly suffering and maimed women and children that Americans have been watching for over six months. Jewish intellectuals like the author Marsha Gessen, who compared Gaza to the ghettoes in Poland during the Holocaust, have faced derision from Zionists, but their silencing has been viewed with alarm by everyone else. Israel is America’s spoilt child. It is used to throwing a tantrum on the floor of the toy store if it does not get whatever impractical plaything or ridiculous demand it makes. It is likely to continue with its behaviour beyond an invasion of Rafah just to have the last word and pretend at some imaginary ‘victory’. There are plenty of hardliners in Israel who even imagine themselves and their country as being able to conduct wars without the assistance of the US. It is just one of the many delusions that have led Israel to where it has ended up after inflicting six months of merciless death and destruction on Palestinian civilians. Its international reputation is in the gutter, people all around the world are up in arms at its genocidal bloodlust, and now even the Americans seem uninterested in standing by their rabid child as it continues to demand a perpetual supply of Palestinian blood to satisfy its desires. Israel may be able to stall aceasefire, and try to take the joy of peace away by insistently inflicting pain on what is left of the Gazans in Rafah. But in its pursuit of this, it will achieve nothing other than becoming the most hated country in the world.

Gaza’s fate,https://www.dawn.com/news/1832151/gazas-fate,,"WAKING up yesterday to the news that Hamas had accepted a ceasefire proposal came as a pleasant surprise, but it did not last long. It was accompanied by reports of Israel’s long-threatened infiltration into Rafah, a day after it had urged 100,000 ‘civilians’ to evacuate a city in Gaza that has become a refuge for almost 1.5 million Palestinians. The sector subsequently began to be pounded — presumably with ammunition supplied by the US and UK — under the apparent assumption that any Hamas operatives in the area would not have left among the tens of thousands who evacuated on foot, by vehicles or on donkey carts. Almost every international ally of the Zionist regime has seemingly tried to talk it out of invading Rafah, yet their weapons keep flowing to Israel. Global history is peppered with instances of hypocrisy, but seldom have they been as egregious or stark as in 2024. In the past, sufficiently serious cautions from Washington have often produced the desired effect by at least temporarily reducing Israeli excesses. Benjamin Netanyahu, however, falls in a different category. Any semblance of a pause in hostilities, let alone a sustainable ceasefire, would spell his doom. The revived demonstrations in Israeli cities are by no means dedicated to securing a ceasefire, although some of the protesters support that goal. Their demands on Gaza are somewhat more oblique, but invariably entail the return of the surviving hostages — which would inevitably involve at least a temporary cessation of hostilities. But any kind of peace, however fragile, does not suit Netanyahu. Apart from the indictments for corruption, he presides over a regime that ignored — possibly deliberately — the clear warning signs of a Hamas assault against kibbutzim on the periphery of Gaza, populated to a considerable extent by Jews who do not buy into the narrative of exclusively Jewish nationhood. Peace of any kind does not suit Netanyahu. Netanyahu and his more vicious allies are almost as contemptuous of conciliatory Jews, Israeli or otherwise, as they are of Palestinians. In their blighted vision, the Jewish students participating in protests in the US, UK or Australia are far more problematic than the goyim who can more easily be dismissed as antisemitic. The anti-genocide protests have been spreading beyond the US to Europe and even Australia, with the encampments routinely derided by antagonistic politicians pointing out that Jewish students feel intimidated — albeit presumably not as much as children, women and men in Gaza, where the death toll since Oct 7 is approaching 35,000. Later this week, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) is expected to vote on whether to admit Palestine as a full member, yet a probable vote overwhelmingly in favour of the proposition won’t cut ice with the Security Council, where the US veto will prevail, as it has so many times whenever a challenge to Zionism has been considered. Almost 50 years ago, in November 1974, Yasser Arafat addressed the UNGA, having arrived with his holster and an olive branch, famously declaring: “Today I have come bearing an olive branch and a freedom fighter’s gun. Do not let the olive branch fall from my hand”. In his landmark speech, Arafat decried Zionist acts of “barbarism” and the “temerity” of the “Zionists and colonialists … to describe the just struggle of our people as terror”. A couple of decades before the post-Oslo Palestinian Authority he initially presided over became a handmaiden of the Zionist occupation, Arafat pointed out to the UN that “when it became obvious that the Palestinians would not recuperate one inch of Palestine through exclusively political means, our people had no choice but to resort to armed struggle”. He made no mention of a two-state so­­lution, which is currently the favoured option among many of those who have contributed over the decades towards diminishing the possibility of such an outcome. Arafat held out a long-term hope for “one democratic state where Christian, Jew and Muslim live in justice, equality and fraternity”. That remains a dead man’s dream. Neither a one-state nor a two-state outcome is on the cards, and that would not change with Netanyahu’s replacement by a superficially less obnoxious figurehead. The drift towards Palestinian genocide dates back at least to 1947-48, and the resistance to it has been equally evident since then. The olive branch that Arafat brought to the UN didn’t fall. It was effectively wrested from his hand. All too many olive trees have been chopped down since then, particularly after the Oslo ‘process’, when the trend towards illegal settlements was ramped up, backed by successive US governments. Replacing the Netanyahu regime with an equally absurd alternative would only mean that, a further 50 years hence, future generations will still be marvelling at the impotence of their ancestors. mahir.dawn@gmail.com Published in Dawn, May 8th, 2024"
Fly on Great Wall,https://www.dawn.com/news/1832150/fly-on-great-wall,,"AS our great neighbour becomes greater by the day, we are moving from being ‘another brick in the wall’ to nothing more than a fly on the wall — the Great Wall, that is. Geographical proximity and the mostly congenial nature of ties notwithstanding, do we really know China? Folklore in the Gilgit-Baltistan region would have you believe that before the ancient mountain passes fell into disuse, one could run with a hot chapati and arrive on the Chinese side with the bread still warm. Exaggeration, perhaps, but the road distance between Islamabad and Tash- kur­gan, the Chinese border town, via the Khunjerab Pass is half the distance between the federal capital and Karachi. Besides the fabled Silk Road, the Great Wall, the Xinjiang region, and the names of a few cosmopolitan centres like Beijing and Shanghai, most of us would be hard-pressed to name a couple more cities or regions. All of it can’t be blamed on the lack of curiosity on the part of China’s neighbours, particularly in the subcontinent. The ebb and flow of our interest in knowing China has also been regulated by policy decisions in great Chinese capitals over the millennia. How two of the greatest civilisations on earth can live cheek by jowl and yet be barely acquainted has been discussed in detail by Shyam Saran, former diplomat and author, in his wonderfully narrated book How China Sees India And The World. Two of the greatest civilisations barely know one another. How the subcontinent and China have managed to remain indifferent towards each other for most of recorded history is marked by epochs of respectful distance and eons of self-importance bordering on disdain on the latter’s part. In the first millennium, people of the Middle Kingdom regarded India with some awe as an emblem of Eastern sophistication and spirituality. In the second millennium, everything beyond the core of the Mandate of Heaven began to be considered ‘barbaric’. Trade caravans through the storied Silk Road — in reality, a microcosm of routes and maritime exchanges through the ports in southern India — preceded the even more talked-about Indian export, the teachings of Lord Buddha. Monks from both sides crisscrossing the mountain passes, Central Asian steppes, sea routes, and the Tibetan plateau never outnumbered the merchants of silk, porcelain, jade, and spices. Tibet and the fight over it between the two neighbours came much later. It’s unimaginable today that Tibet, a Shangri-La wrapped in a mythical mist between 8th and 9th CE, extended its control to present-day Yunnan, Sichuan, Inner Mongolia, and the Mongolian People’s Republic. Images of Tibet for us swing between the sublimity of Buddhist monasteries, to things as pedestrian as a plaza famous for auto parts in Karachi, and a moisturiser-cum skin-lightening agent named after snow from the roof of the world. The difficult-to-translate Arab tradition of al-wala, wal-bara (embrace the beneficial and disavow the harmful) can be seen at work during Mao’s speech to the politburo in 1962, before the Indo-Chinese border war. While describing the ‘one-and-a-half’ prior wars between them, he declared a skirmish between a Tang dynasty diplomatic mission to India in 647 CE and a local adventurer who tried to usurp King Harsha’s throne in Kanauj a full war, whereas Timur’s attack in 1398 merited only the status of a ‘half war’, owing to his Mongolian identity. How interesting that a Muslim invasion against their coreligionists’ rule in India, and the indiscriminate horror unleashed by the conquering hordes, is owned by another country, albeit half-heartedly because of Timur’s Mongol identity. Ev­­eryone outside of the Middle King­dom, the centre of the Chinese civilisation between the Yellow and Yangtze rivers, qualified, at best, as ‘half-Chinese.’ This sort of accounting can also be described as ‘too clever by half’ or ‘dedh-hoshyari’, its Urdu equivalent. The two-way influences of the Chinese and Indus-Gandhara civilisations are too numerous to list here. A few disparate ex­­a­mples are ‘Tanchoi’, commonly known as the ‘Banarasi’ sari, which derives its name from three Gujarati artisans who travelled to Shanghai in 1856 as apprentices to one Mr Chhoi, a famous silk weaver. ‘Tan’ means three in Gujarati dialects, and when the weavers returned to Surat, Tanchoi was born. As demand for the fabric decreased, the artisans and their craft shifted to Banaras, and the name has stuck since. ‘Zen’, meaning meditation, evolved from the Sanskrit word ‘dhyana’. ‘Bokhara’, is a variation of ‘vihara’, meaning monastery. Central Asia was a bastion of Bud­dh­ism before the Muslim influence. Archae­olo­g­ists like Aurel Stein called the entire Cen­tral Asian zone ‘Serindia’. The affinities and irritants between Pakistan and China have been left out for another piece. The writer is a poet.

Something’s gotta give,https://www.dawn.com/news/1832002/somethings-gotta-give,,"IT has been almost a year since May 9. In the coming days, much will be said and written about this unfortunate day, its significance and tragedy. There will also be heated discussions about the many individuals accused — imprisoned or not — and the unrepentant PTI. But as with much else, there will be little serious discussion on how to move forward in a meaningful way, because honesty is rarely possible in public discussions. And a candid discussion would focus on the relationship between the establishment and the PTI and how this impacts the country. Take the PTI first. Notwithstanding the gloomy predictions about its demise and the quick departures of its stalwarts 12 months ago, the party managed to do well in the elections despite all the odds against it. But now, it seems stuck once again in old and new challenges. Even when in power, the PTI was a noisy organisation with little discipline. In these trying times, this hasn’t changed. With limited access to Imran Khan, the party appears to be a headless chicken. And, as old rivalries are maintained in time-honoured PTI tradition, new entrants such as lawyers and the older lot of politicians are also jostling with each other.  Decision-making has become even more chaotic. Dependent on when party leaders can meet Khan and who talks to the media after meeting him, the decisions at times are the famed ‘U-turns,’ while at others it seems that the entire lot is stuck at a roundabout, unable to locate any exit. Consider the choice of KP finance minister. It seems that the chief minister-designate was able to ignore Khan’s instructions because of his personal discomfort. Or the absoluteconfusionabout who was going to be the party’s choice to head the Public Accounts Committee. For weeks, there was no clarity on whether or not Sher Afzal Khan Marwat, a missile who lands as often on the PTI as it does on its rivals, would be the party’s choice or someone else. The issue was resolved with the party choosing Sheikh Waqas, according toDawn, but after much drama, with little logic. Poor decision-making has been held responsible for the party’s misfortunes rather than its run-ins with the establishment. This may not matter in the long run. What is more critical is the party’s limited choices. Its popularity is now at a point where it can no longer be denied by anyone — but it comes at a cost. Keeping in mind the mood of the electorate, the PTI will lose support if it reaches an understanding with the current set-up or the establishment. (The PML-N’s diminishing support proves this.) But neither can it sustain the stand-off. The establishment faces just as difficult a choice as the PTI. Consider the dynamics in KP, where the initial euphoria is giving way to criticism; Ali Amin Gandapur especially, and the party in general, are being accused by workers of being compromised. This has been particularly true of the government’s silence in the face of the disappearance of a PTI worker in recent days. Indeed, every small ‘instance’ of compromise or inaction is being seen as a sign of betrayal — such is the level of emotion. But without developing a working relationship with the centre or the establishment, how will the party govern? For now, the party has no answers. (Similar pressures are at work in Punjab.) However, this is not just a dilemma for the PTI, but also the establishment, which historically has always engaged with popular forces after confrontation. This happened with the PPP in the 1980s and the PML-N in the noughties. Many argue it won’t be any different this time, though of course the time frame in each of the two cases has been closer to a decade. But that was when the country wasn’t in the midst of an intractable economic crisis — a principal reason why the PTI has become the force it is. Indeed, carrying the burden of an unpopular government as well as the economy is not all that easy for an establishment that has usually been able to lay claim to public support from regions such as Punjab. But this time around, there are no goodies to share to make up for sidelining a popular party; in fact, there is just bad news in the shape of taxes or higher bills. It appears, as the last one year indicates, that the only way to manage such a situation is to use repressive measures on ordinary people, politicians and mainstream and social media.  The problem, however, with an enforced quiet is that it has to be enforced — continuously. Even then, it cannot overcome the lack of legitimacy or support; which is why in the past the establishment has always opted for a ‘reset’ eventually. In other words, the establishment faces just as difficult a choice as the PTI. If nothing changes, the pendulum will continue to swing in Khan’s favour. Consider that before Khan was arrested, there was chatter about how he continued in comfort at the expense of his party and its members. But then, he was arrested and the criticism died down. Now it is worth asking what the price of easing restrictions on Khan will be. Will it be possible to control the public reaction if he is allowed out in public in the near future, even in terms of a simple court appearance? And if there is no ceasefire, how will the establishment manage public anger and expectations, especially as it prepares for the next IMF programme? That there is realisation of this explains the constant pressure for or discussion of how the political parties need to ‘talk’. Doubting Thomases find it hard to believe this stems from the charter of democracy fandom or those who want to cheer on the establishment and the PTI together. A year on, something has to give. Reason demands this, even though it has been in short supply in Pakistan for quite some time. In the process, both the PTI and the establishment will have to pay a price. The writer is a journalist.

Citizens, particularly parents, caught in Pakistan’s grave drug problem are on edge. Despite frequent reports of police and the ANF busting drug cartels, information about legal actions against peddlers is as scant as the conviction rate. The Organised Crime Unit of Lahore has captured an international ring that provided narcotics and ‘party drugs’ to elite youth. These criminals — the Jordan Gang — ran a network from Central Asia, Mexico, Canada, the US and other countries, and supplied exorbitantly priced drugs in Lahore and Multan, targeting select students in academic institutions. Their modus operandi — offer deals to youngsters on the internet through fake IDs and in partnership with corrupt GPO and police officials — should be a cause of concern for the authorities. This is not the first attempt at infecting the young: last August, two security officials at the Islamic University of Bahawalpur were caught with crystal meth and offensive videos of teachers and students. The Punjab Police released an alarming report last month: some 234 police officers were involved in the drug trade across Punjab. Young people are experimental, anxious and restless, keen to dodge routine with a heady hit. Small wonder, then, that public health experts urge policymakers and law enforcement to understand that punishment-driven strategies are counterproductive. Instead, they must weed out rogue personnel and powerful groups who claim a lion’s share of the profits from narcotic rackets, so that sealing supply routes, including those along a porous border, is successful. The crisis also demands awareness campaigns and collaboration among parents, NGOs and educational facilities to identify signs of addiction and provide therapy and rehabilitation. Long-term success hinges on restructured narcotic courts so that faster trials can ensure a rise in conviction levels — the latter should, ideally, match the regularity of narcotic seizures. This country cannot allow addiction to rip through society and ravage our future generations. Published in Dawn, May 8th, 2024"

Over the past month, Prime...","PLANS to bring Saudi investment to Pakistan have clearly been put on the fast track. Over the past month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has visited the kingdom on two separate occasions, meeting the crown prince on both, while the Saudi foreign minister was in Islamabad in April, accompanied by other high officials. The latest in this series of top-level exchanges was a two-day investment conference held in the federal capital, which wrapped up on Tuesday. The Saudi side was represented by the assistant minister for investment, who brought with him a 50-member delegation representing 30 Saudi companies. Speaking at a reception on Monday for the Arab visitors, Mr Sharif said the time was near when bilateral business deals “worth billions of dollars” would be finalised. When he met Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in early April, it had been reported that Riyadh was looking to invest $5bn in Pakistan. During the just-concluded conference, the Saudi assistant minister said his country saw Pakistan as a “high-priority economic investment and business opportunity”. While $5bn of Saudi money will not turn around the Pakistani economy, such investments will send a signal to the world that this country is open for business. For too long, we have depended on foreign and multilateral loans and financial aid to keep the ship afloat, when courting foreign investment as well as ramping up exports is a far more sustainable model to uplift the economy. Saudi Arabia appears to be a natural choice to spearhead this campaign to attract foreign funds. Bilateral ties are old and deep, and have survived periods of turbulence. Pakistan has for decades exported labour to the kingdom, and benefited from the foreign exchange these workers send home. Moreover, the House of Sharif enjoys a close rapport with the House of Saud, a relationship which can be leveraged for the benefit of both states. But as has been written in these columns earlier, investment from Riyadh or any other foreign partner will benefit Pakistan most when there is internal political harmony, as well as transparency in policies. The Saudi crown prince is due in Pakistan soon — according to some reports, he may arrive in the next few days. The state should use the visit to cement the deals already discussed, so that work on the projects can begin in earnest. Published in Dawn, May 8th, 2024"
Reserved seats,https://www.dawn.com/news/1832154/reserved-seats,"The truth is that the entire process — from polls, announcement of results, formation of assemblies and elections to the Senate — has been mishandled.","IT is usually best not to presume, but given recent developments, one may tentatively hope that the judiciary has finally woken up to the controversies surrounding the general election. Following a series of widely criticised decisions from the Election Commission of Pakistan — each of which, it seems, distorted or subverted the public mandate — the judiciary has finally checked the electoral body for exercising arbitrary control over the democratic process. A three-member bench of the Supreme Court admitted a petition this Monday against an ECP decision to give various political parties more reserved seats than they were lawfully entitled to,suspendingthedecisiontill further notice. The petition in question was moved by the Sunni Ittehad Council, which has been arguing that the ECP and Peshawar High Court’s denial of its right to a total of 78 reserved seats in various assemblies was unlawful and must, therefore, be reviewed by the apex court. From the interim order issued by the Supreme Court, it appears that the judges who heard the petition were not inclined to agree with the government and the ECP’s logic regarding why the 78 reserved seats denied to the SIC should be allotted to other parties. During proceedings, the court observed that this decision appeared to have distorted the public’s mandate. Since there was no legal precedent or clear justification for the ECP’s decision, it was agreed that the question would require a constitutional interpretation. The matter has consequently been remanded to the apex committee of the Supreme Court for the formation of a larger bench. Till the case is decided, the interim order also, in effect, scuppered any government plans to start tinkering with the Constitution thanks to the two-thirds majority it had secured in the Lower House due to the ECP’s decision. This may be for the best. One of the other big questions at the moment is what is to be made of theSenate electionsheld recently, in which the lawmakers who currently occupy the challenged seats also voted. In case the Supreme Court strikes down the ECP’s decision, would that mean that the Senate election could be challenged on related grounds? This could prove to be a major headache for the government, as it would further undermine its already questionable legitimacy. If such a situation comes to pass, those affected will only have the ECP to blame. The truth is that the entire process — from polls, announcement of results, formation of assemblies and elections to the Senate — has been mishandled. The electoral watchdog has been so busy finding faults in and imposing penalties on one party that it has been unable to reflect on the many disasters it has wrought in the process. It should deal with the consequences itself. Published in Dawn, May 8th, 2024"

Modi’s BJP toils as Indian elections lock 52pc seats,https://www.dawn.com/news/1832189/modis-bjp-toils-as-indian-elections-lock-52pc-seats,Three Haryana MLAs ditch Modi govt to join Congress; police chase away Muslim voters from polling booths in BJP-ruled constituency.,"SAMBHAL (Uttar Pradesh): People queue to vote at a polling station during the third phase of the general election, on Tuesday.—Reuters • Three Haryana MLAs ditch Modi govt to join Congress• Police chase away Muslim voters from polling booths in BJP-ruled constituency• X told to take down Congress leaders’ animated video over code violation NEW DELHI: With the third phase of the elections ending on Tuesday, the fate of 52 per cent candidates for the 543-seat parliament stands sealed, and analysts were reading the turbulence at the stock exchanges as a sign of difficulties for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Another sign of trouble for the Bharatiya Janata Party came from Haryana where three independent state MLAs ditched the BJP government to join the Congress party. Hitherto the flow of big and small political defectors had been in the other direction — from opposition groups to the BJP. There were reports of police chasing away Muslim voters from polling booths in a constituency in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh. Elsewhere names of some voters had allegedly disappeared from the voters’ list. In the fray on Tuesday were 94 seats spread over 12 states, including all 26 seats in Gujarat where Mr Modi and his home ministercast their votes. The day’s contests included five seats in Bihar, four in West Bengal, 11 in Maharashtra, seven in Chhatt­isgarh, 10 in Uttar Pradesh, 14 in Karnataka and nine in Madhya Pradesh, where Congress defector and BJP candidate Jyotiraditya Scindia was in the race. Of these states, Karnataka and West Bengal are ruled by the opposition. The fate of 285 seats is now sealed. The Election Commission of India (ECI) ordered X, formerly Twitter, to take down an animated video posted by BJP Karnataka but avoided directly sending a notice to the BJP. The video features caricatures of Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge, advancing the party’s recent messaging that the Congress is diverting funds and resources away from lower caste Hindus towardsMuslims. As of Tuesday evening, the post had garnered over nine million views, and had not yet been taken down, reports said. The Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee had on May 5 complained that the video violated the code of conduct, and Manoj Kumar Meena, the chief electoral officer of the state, subsequently ordered X to take the post down. In a setback to the ruling BJP in Haryana amid the Lok Sabha election, three independent MLAs have withdrawn their support to the Nayab Singh Saini-led government in the state, reports said. The three MLAs — Sombir Sangwan, Randhir Gollen and Dharampal Gonder — made the announcement at a press conference held in Rohtak in the presence of senior Congress leader and former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Haryana Congress chief Udai Bhan. After their presser, Mr Hooda claimed that the Saini government had lost its majority. Their extension of support to the Congress, he claimed, proved that there is a wave for the party in the state and that “we are poised to perform well in the ongoing Lok Sabha polls”. Mr Saini took over state reins two months ago in March after the BJP broke off its alliance with the Dushyant Chautala-led Jannayak Janata Party and dissolved the government under chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar. On the other hand, the Indian stock market has been experiencing strong bouts of volatility in recent sessions, leaving investors perplexed, reports said. Analysts have linked the fall to problems Mr Modi is facing in his third term bid. The India VIX index, which measures volatility in the Indian stock market, has surged nearly 33pc in just four sessions in May so far, following a meagre 0.30pc rise in April and a significant 18pc fall in March. On Tuesday, after opening higher, Indian stock market benchmarks, the Sensex and the Nifty 50 soon fell almost a per cent each on an all-round selloff. Both indices, however, pared losses and ended about half a percent lower each. Published in Dawn, May 8th, 2024"

India’s new birth,https://www.dawn.com/news/1831727/indias-new-birth,Can the BJP continue to shepherd the 150m voters it rounded up in the past two elections?,"INDIANelectionsare no less than a nightmare for psephologists: election experts. To begin with, the scale of the exercise is mind-boggling. Every sixth adult walking on earth is registered as a voter in India. Add to this the complex interplay of a multitude of political discourses centred on caste, class, religion, ethnicity, language, and ideologies and it becomes impossible to navigate through the maze. However, thanks to robust and trustworthy data on past elections, one can still dig out some features that can help in at least understanding the current scenario. India has a first-past-the-post poll system. The contestant securing the highest number of votes is declared the winner whether or not he or she gets the majority of votes polled in a constituency. This complicates the correlation between votes polled by a party and the number of seats it wins. To quote an example, the third biggest party in the 2014 election, the UP-based Bahujan Samaj Party, secured 23 million votes but could not win a single seat while the Bengal-based Trinamool Congress polled 2m less votes than the BSP but won 34 of 543 Lok Sabha seats.  There is, however, some method deep inside this madness. Historical data shows that while uncertainty about the number of seats won remains high for a party securing less than 30 per cent of the total polled votes, a simple majority in Lok Sabha (272 seats) comes within its reach as soon as it crosses this mark. The BJP won the majority of seats in 2014 and 2019 while polling 31pc and 37pc of the total polled votes respectively. Past data also shows that if a party crosses the 40pc mark, it will hit the two-thirds majority (363 seats) jackpot. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s 2024 campaign slogan ‘abki bar, 400 par’ is pinned on hopes of bettering the party’s vote share by at least five percentage points. But hold on. A 5pc increase means at least 30m more voters coming out insupport of Modicompared to 2019. This would be no mean feat at a time when voters are identifying rising inflation and unemployment as their main concerns while the inauguration of the Ram temple has failed to impress them. Now that the voter turnout is dropping, will the BJP suffer the most? Indian voters’ dissatisfaction is already finding expression as fewer people are turning up this time than the previous election. In the first two of theseven phasesof voting, the turnout has been almost five percentage points lower than in 2019. The turnout in India has traditionally hovered around 60pc. It was the Modi wave that inspired it to take a leap of faith in 2014 when it reached its highest-ever level of 66.4pc representing an increase of 8.3 percentage points over 2009. The wave pushed it up further in 2019 by one percentage point. The BJP has been the sole beneficiary of a high turnout as no other party could increase its percentage share in the votes in these elections. But now that the turnout is dropping, will the BJP suffer the most? This is possible but if it succeeds in deflecting this downturn towards regional parties, it may actually benefit from the dip as much as it had from its rise. Data shows that voters in India have remained evenly poised between regional and national parties. In eight general elections since 1991, regional parties have on average been favoured by 49pc of voters while the remaining 51pc were divided between the two national parties. This in itself is a reflection of Indians’ collective perception of their state. The BJP couldn’t damage this equation much in its first elections under Modi. As the party increased its share in polled votes by 12 percentage points, Congress lost nine and regional parties three. However, after cowing its arch rival, the sultan of Delhi turned towards the rajas and ranis of India’s 28 states. The BJP’s share in polled votes rose by six percentage points in the second election under Modi while that of regional parties reduced by the same measure. Since then, the BJP is trying to get deeper into the den of regional parties. The crackdown on leaders of these parties, launched just before elections, implicating them in corruption and criminal cases, is aimed at demoralising their support bases, thereby compensating its own potential loss in polled votes. The BJP, however, has its own Achilles’ heel: new voters instrumental to its phenomenal rise are now disgruntled by unemployment and inflation.  An unprecedented 117m new voters were added to the rolls in 2014 and supplemented by a euphoric turnout; 137m more had appeared in polling stations in this election than previously. The BJP had pocketed a hefty 93m of these. Congress not only failed to attract them, it lost 12m of its 2009 voters. Regional parties, however, braved the Modi wave and added a good 58m to their collective vote bank. The rolls for 2019 swelled further by 78m. Congress held its ground this time sustaining its depleted percentage share of 2014 but regional parties conceded substantial ground to the BJP. Their collective share in votes dropped to 43pc, the lowest since 1984. Another 58m voters have been added in 2024. Will regional parties reclaim lost ground? Can the BJP continue to shepherd the 150m voters it rounded up in the past two elections? Will they stay loyal to the third avatar of Modi, which now carries a blurred halo? Will INDIA prove to be a new janam for India? We will know the answers on June 4. If, however, the BJP succeeds in bulldozing the regional half of Indian politics, it will fundamentally change Indian politics. One cannot say whether Modi’s victory in 2024 will finally midwife ‘one nation’ conceived by his party but it will surely smoothen India into ‘one market’ with no local bumps and blips. That may be actually what BJP’s sponsors — the rising Indian capitalist elite — want it to deliver. The writer heads the media platform loksujag.com. Published in Dawn, May 6th, 2024"
The Iranian story,https://www.dawn.com/news/1831996/the-iranian-story,Iranians’ pride in their culture and history is supreme.,"A FEW days after the triumphant arrival of Ayatollah Khomeini in Tehran in February 1979, four Pakistani students were having a meal in a suburban restaurant when they were surrounded by Kalashnikov-bearing Iranian Revolutio­nary Guards, who were inexperienced and more nervous than the students. They were like this because the Shah’s ruthless regime had ensured that no one, other than state functionaries, possessed a weapon. As one of the four students, I recalled the incident at the time of the visit of the Iranian president to Pakistan recently. I was studying in an institution set up by the Harvard Business School, on the request of the Shah, to give Iranians a modern business education in their own country. The public was so happy when the Shah fled that shops selling sweets ran empty. People, delirious with joy, were out on the streets displaying currency notes with the Shah’s picture torn out. Young people were shouting “Shah raft” (the Shah’s left). APCs and tanks, looted from abandoned cantonments, were being driven on the streets of Tehran by euphoric teenagers. The four of us, all raised in a Western-oriented, English-medium environment, were confused. We felt sympathy for the citizens of Iran, who had been taken over by the mullahs. We felt fortunate to be citizens of Pakistan, where despite all our democratic shenanigans (Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was on trial but had not been hanged yet), we still had a tolerant government. There was nothing equivalent to Iran’s secret service Savak, which had its fleet of ‘Vigos’ to ‘fix’ and eliminate dissidents. Iranians’ pride in their culture and history is supreme. Khomeini’s arrival heralded the curbing of civil liberties. For instance, women, many of whom were used to wearing tight jeans and short skirts in public, could now no longer leave their homes without hijab. Our sympathies were with our Western-oriented class fellows, most of whom had to flee the country. We felt Iran was in for the long grind at the hands of an inexperienced and dogmatic clergy. Forty-five years later, after watching the Iranian armed forces take on the biggest bully in the region, Israel, and scaring it into backing off through guts, technology and a very well thought-out military manoeuvre, I am compelled to change my mind. The Iranians have shown that they value their self-respect and beliefs more than their worldly comforts. They have not blinked in 45 years against the most dominant country in the world — the US — and its allies, despite having undergone isolation and economic deprivation, and the harassment of Iranian citizens. Because of their grit and national pride, they have become a self-reliant and proud nation with their own, indigenous industry, both commercial and military. Their military prowess, despite facing sanctions, is creditable. A photo in the media showing their military high command sitting at the feet of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, when he congratulated them on the Israeli operation, felt unreal to a Pakistani. Despite a domineering Islamic regime, the Iranians’ pride in their culture and history is supreme. The Iranian new year Nauroze, which is basically a Zoroastrian festival, is still the most important event in the Iranian calendar. The country closes down for three weeks to celebrate it. The celebration of two Eids is hardly notable in this context. The Islamic government greatly respects citizens’ privacy (chador and chardiwari) and believes in the principle that what you do inside your home is your business. I asked an Iranian friend about this contradiction in the perceived harshness of the regime. He said that during the Shah’s time, “we used to drink publicly and pray privately; now we pray publicly and drink privately”. People who have travelled to Iran recently talk about a clean and developed country, with good roads, an efficient and modern railway system and huge modern shopping malls. Their literacy level is 89 per cent compared to our 58pc; their expenditure on education is 23pc of the budget, while we spend 11.5pc; on health, they spend 23pc, while we spend 4.3pc. These figures indicate that they prioritise human development. True, Iran has it problems, including corruption, but it still ranks 24 on the Global Corruption Index, while we are at 133rd position. It is depressing to compare ourselves with our other neighbours too. India and Bangladesh are way ahead of us, economically and in human development indices. Even Afghanistan seems to be better than us in the context of law and order. On the economic front, their currency is stronger and stabler than ours. Four Pakistan rupees is equal to one Afghani. The reasons for the continued decline of Pakistan are many, but the primary one for me is that the people who control power are not made accountable. While I felt proud as a Pakistani 45 years ago, I am not sure I do anymore. The writer is a former civil servant. Published in Dawn, May 7th, 2024"
Improving skills,https://www.dawn.com/news/1831725/improving-skills,The more successful teachers find motivation within themselves.,"MANY teachers complain about the lack of continuous professional development opportunities or resources to update their teaching and learning skills. Like any other profession, teaching calls for creating opportunities on the job, taking initiative to learn new techniques and to continually revise teaching methods for greater efficiency. Churning the same wheel has never been gratifying — at best, it may help teachers keep their jobs and continue on the same path for decades. The world is evolving rapidly and those in employment today are being referred to as Generation Transition for they have had to keep abreast of massive changes to stay relevant in their professions. AI may not be taking up teachers’ jobs — at least yet — but it has done enough to show teachers what they don’t know and how much there is to learn. It has shown more efficient ways of working in a minimal amount of time. From strategy to projected outcomes, from planning to design and execution, it has a quicker solution for work that would otherwise take days if not months to accomplish. With new developments in technology, creating opportunities for oneself has never been easier. Learning new skills or upgrading old ones no longer requires huge effort. Most teaching programmes are free and can be accessed anywhere, anytime. The doors to teaching and learning from successful trends in other societies are no longer closed. There is a treasure trove of research for teachers to dip into. It is now possible for teachers to learn from the professional experiences of individuals far and wide and to stay abreast of global developments, without relying on colleagues and managers to fill their coffers with knowledge and expertise. A teacher who has taught successfully for decades wrote to me recently, worrying that he is no longer relevant, not motivated enough and that his managers don’t value him the way they did before. The question that may need to be answered is, ‘what is he doing differently to upgrade his teaching and to enable or empower his students?’ Motivation can come from external factors, and appreciation or approval from colleagues may be temporarily beneficial, but external factors are never sustainable. Reliance on the external environment means we change when our environment changes and we no longer feel worthwhile when our colleagues don’t pump up the gas to help us feel valued. The more successful teachers find motivation within themselves. Instead of relying on external factors, the more successful teachers find motivation within themselves to upgrade their skills and contribute to reshaping their external environment. Often teachers feel demotivated as they procrastinate, delay grading or reuse lesson plans knowing well that new, upgraded ones are required. They wait to be called out on that, wait to be told what to do, wait for an opportunity to feel better and to do better. Yet, a lot can change with an individual’s willingness to take initiative — to start with doing a few things differently and watch the outcomes closely. A small example is that of a teacher who complains through the term about a couple of students who do not study, don’t complete their homework and don’t show interest in class. A good place to start would be to do something differently for those students — perhaps start with active ‘inclusion’ techniques that develop a sense of comfort and well-being for the child. Many teachers choose to stick to tried and tested methods that have worked for them, but, unfortunately, are a thing of the past, such as teacher-led explanations and note-taking. Hundreds of schools still follow this strategy in a bid to ‘cover’ the syllabus. If they were to venture into lea­rning more effic­i­e­­nt ways of student-centred teaching, they would find it works so much better in our world of massive ‘transition’. Not only do the students benefit from upgraded te­­aching methods, teachers themselves would find it gratifying and motivating. There are virtual conferences, webinars and massive open online courses that can enable teachers to bring technology into the classrooms. According to a McKinsey 2023 report, The Skills Revolution and the Future of Earning and Learning’, a skills-first approach transforming the learning paradigm is critical for the students’ readiness for the 21st century. The same report states that “high-performing teachers can raise the performance of students by 53 percentage points in PISA scores, on average, over that of similar students with low-performing teachers”. Given the critical role of teachers, keeping up with technological changes and focusing on upgrading skills can yield lifelong returns for students and teachers.

Extra baggage,https://www.dawn.com/news/1831997/extra-baggage,A bloated government workforce is hindering progress.,"UNDISPUTEDLY, the most important, most versatile and most indispensable person in a government office is the naib qasid, often the only moving component of an inert piece of machinery. He is the critical hub, an integral element of a governance system designed for a colonial era. He not only knows the location but also the contents of files and papers that drive and define a government. Naib qasids carry files from one office to another, perform housekeeping, ask visitors to wait, serve tea to their masters, and search, shelve, lose, find, misplace or retrieve files and records — depending upon their mood and motivation. Using the ‘right to information’ law, our research, which is spread over a sample of 15 well-known and highly esteemed government organisations, such as National Savings, the Benazir Income Support Programme, the Employees’ Old-Age Benefits Institution (EOBI), the Supreme Court and the Wafaqi Mohtasib, yields startling results. First, 23 per cent of the entire government of Pakistan consists of just one category of individuals — often called ‘qasids’, ‘naib qasids’ or ‘daftaris’. As per the data provided under the right to information law, the Supreme Court (SC) tops this list with 283 (34pc) qasids and naib qasids, out of a total of 833 regular and contingent employees. Another prominent mention is BISP, that employs 473 qasids out of a total of 2,356 employees. Such governance through naib qasids would be inconceivable in any developed country, where officials must perform their own chores. The study gets yet more overwhelming as it reveals that the employees designated as upper division clerks, lower division clerks or steno typists constitute 26.8pc of the entire government of Pakistan. Although most offices have acquired computers and most senior officers have obtained laptops (at taxpayers’ expense), there is no let-up in the demand or number of UDCs and LDCs. One wonders why emails, used by the rest of the world for the last 30 years, are still not an accepted form of official correspondence. Have low skills and high status become our biggest hindrance to progress? Should the conditions of employment not specify that every bureaucrat must carry his own briefcase, drive his own (private) car, clean his own table, receive, respond and file his own mail electronically, make his own tea, etc? The next mind-boggling segment of employees — 22.7pc of government— sadly comprises chowkidars and private security guards. National Savings, with 1,270 security guards, champions this class, followed by Pakistan Post’s 754 guards and BISP’s 386 chowkidars. There is also no guilt for cruelty on the part of our esteemed organisations who engage guards through private security companies, not registering them with the EOBI and paying them less than half the minimum legal wage for performing 12-hour duty each day. A bloated government workforce is hindering progress. From this, we can conclude that 72.5pc of the entire government of Pakistan consists of three categories of employees: qasids/ naib qasids, UDCs/ LDCs, and guards/ chowkidars. Like ministers, many are inducted on considerations of ‘relative’, ‘friend’, ‘party’, ‘clan’, etc. Must we not ponder why Pakistan Railways operates with 315 employees per train, as opposed to the Indian Railways’ 53, and Japan Railway’s 5.9? Why does the SC operate with 833 employees and its British counterpart with 64 employees for around the same number of judges? It is time to admit that only by shedding 70pc of our government workforce will Pakistan see progress. There are at least two main approaches to reducing the size of this mountain — firstly, by using te­­chnology to perfo­rm all those functions that can enhance efficiency and convenience. National Savings’ latest software, which req­ui­res no citizen to visit a savings centre and to automatically re­­ceive profits in a designated bank, is a brilliant example. Resultantly, National Savings can potentially cut down 70pc of its employees and branches. The other approach is to eliminate all that is redundant or ceremonial. Almost all commissions and bureaus (NCHR, NCRC, NCSW, etc.) can be closed and their functions performed by their parent ministries. Numerous ministries such as health, human rights, religious affairs and overseas Pakistanis could be merged and renamed the ‘Ministry for Health & Population’. In this manner, Pakistan could reduce the total number of ministries (and logically the ministers) from 32 to 10. These two approaches ought to be identically emulated by the defence services as well as the provincial governments. Our governance system is dysfunctional and bloated. It exists only to preserve the luxuries of an extractive class. Its dismantling is a prerequisite for the progress of Pakistan.

Nepra approves Rs2.83 per unit hike in FCA for May power bills,https://www.dawn.com/news/1832270/nepra-approves-rs283-per-unit-hike-in-fca-for-may-power-bills,,"The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Wednesday authorised ex-Wapda distribution companies (XWDiscos) to levy a Rs2.83 per unit charge in consumers’ electricity bills for May as part of fuel cost adjustment (FCA) charges. Nepra said the FCA pertains to the month of March. According to anotificationissued by Nepra, a copy of which is available withDawn.com, the new adjustment “shall be applicable to all the consumer categories except Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS) and lifeline consumers”. The notification added that this adjustment would be shown in consumers’ bills based on units billed in March. Last month, the government hadsought clearancefrom Nepra to extract about Rs23 billion additional in FCA  from consumers for electricity consumed in March despite 79 per cent of power generation coming from cheaper local fuels. The Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) — a subsidiary of the Power Division — had demanded Rs2.94 per unit additional fuel cost to recover from consumers through May bills. The proposed additional FCA was almost 46pc higher than the pre-fixed fuel cost of Rs6.44 per unit already charged to consumers in March. This raised questions about the power sector bureaucracy’s capabilities to forecast fuel costs even for six to seven months. In recent months, the additional FCAs have ranged between 50 and 115pc higher than the pre-determined fuel costs notified at the start of the current fiscal year. This FCA was on top of about a 26pc increase in the annual base tariff and another 10pc hike under the quarterly tariff adjustment currently in place and being charged to consumers at Rs2.75 per unit. As a result, consumers continue to pay excessive bills despite lower consumption patterns. Nepra had accepted the request for a public hearing on April 26. The higher proposed FCA for March is apparently mainly due to higher domestic coal and gas prices, although the use of imported fuels like coal, diesel and furnace oil remained zero. LNG was relatively cheaper, and the exchange rate remained stable. In a petition, the CPPA, acting as commercial agent of Discos, demanded an additional FCA of Rs2.94 per unit in the May bills for electricity consumed in March. It claimed that the reference fuel cost for March was Rs6.44 per unit, but the actual fuel cost rose to Rs9.38 per unit. The average fuel cost in February also stood at about Rs9.42 per unit. It said about 8,023-gigawatt-hour (GWh) of electricity was generated at an estimated fuel expenditure of Rs66.7bn (Rs8.3 per unit) in March, of which 7,756 GWh energy was delivered to Discos at the cost of Rs72.67bn (at Rs9.38 per unit). The data showed declining consumption trends. The consumption in March was also 8.3pc lower than the same month (8,459Gwh) last year. The Rs2.94 per unit FCA for March sought this year was more than double the Rs1.17 per unit FCA of the same month last year. In the April 26 hearing, Nepra hadcriticisedthe power companies for inefficiencies and the use of expensive power plants despite the availability of cheaper sources but had hinted at allowing them to charge another Rs22.8bn to consumers in the billing month of May."
PM Shehbaz orders formation of Pakistan Skill Company to train overseas Pakistanis,https://www.dawn.com/news/1832262/pm-shehbaz-orders-formation-of-pakistan-skill-company-to-train-overseas-pakistanis,,"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday ordered the establishment the Pakistan Skill Company and Pakistan Skill Development Fund to unify technical and vocational education countrywide and provide better employment to the country’s workers abroad. The prime minister, chairing a high-level meeting reviewing the matters of the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development and National Vocational and Technical Training Commission (NAVTTC), decided to introduce reforms within both organisations. Shehbaz also ordered the immediate establishment of the Pakistan Skill Development Fund, according to a federal government post on X. The premier said NAVTTC should be further enhanced to provide world-class technical and vocational training to the young workforce abroad. He added that “globally renowned and international certifications should be ensured in all fields”.  The prime minister emphasised the importance of greater cooperation between the federal institutions, adding that the “technical training plan should be implemented in line with international standards”. Similarly, he stressed collaboration between the centre and provinces to elevate the quality of Pakistan’s technical manpower and human resource development. He also called for a coordinated and organised database of Pakistani workers in collaboration with Nadra, NAVTTC and provincial institutions, and the establishment of an integrated system to regulate manpower equipped with world-class professional technical skills. Stressing the need for implementing the technical and vocational training plans, the prime minister also ordered reforms to the licensing regime of companies employing skilled Pakistanis abroad. PM Shehbaz said individuals and companies involved in defrauding the people and inflicting financial losses should be identified. He instructed authorities to ensure meritocracy and transparency in the posting of community welfare attaches in Pakistani missions abroad. The prime minister was briefed about the steps taken by NAVTTC regarding the vocational and technical training of the workforce in Pakistan. He was told that NAVTTC would provide vocational and technical training to 60,000 people in 2024, while the figure would rise to 0.6 million in the next three years following the reforms. The meeting’s participants were told that the exchange of information about employment opportunities and required skills from foreign countries was being ensured and that data on manpower consumption was also being obtained from local industries. They were also told that NAVTTC had made the certification of male and female students from internationally renowned institutes mandatory to maintain international vocational and technical training standards."
Saudi Crown Prince MBS expected to arrive within days to seal investment deals,https://www.dawn.com/news/1832202/saudi-crown-prince-mbs-expected-to-arrive-within-days-to-seal-investment-deals,,"• Dar terms talks with Saudi investors’ delegation ‘elaborate’• FM explains did not sanction wheat import as ECC head, reiterates Islamabad won’t take dictation on Pakistan-Iran gas pipeline project ISLAMABAD: Against a flurry of activities between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to boost trade ties, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman is expected to arrive in Pakistan this month toconcludedeals being negotiated between Islamabad and Riyadh. According to Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, dates for the visit had not been communicated to Pakistan, but media reports claimed that the visit was likely on May 10-15. “The crown prince had accepted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s invitation. The visit is on the cards, but no dates have been communicated to us as yet,” FM Darsaidat a briefing on his participation in the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Saudi Arabia and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation meetings in Gambia. He explained that the initial understanding was for discussions to commence at the government level after MBS committed toinvest $5 billion in Pakistan, followed by subsequent talks between business executives. Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud led a ministerial delegation to Islamabad on April 15-16. Later, FM Dar and PM Shehbaz held meetings with Saudi leadership on the sidelines of the WEF and over the past few days a delegation of Saudi businessmen led by the Saudi deputy minister for investment visited Islamabad. FM Dar said discussions with the Saudi business executives were “elaborate and the group left very impressed” with the way Pakistan was proceeding on the issue. He said large projects like Reko Diq and petrochemicals would be undertaken at the government level, but the private sector would collaborate on increasing trade volume and joint ventures. Pak-Iran gas pipeline Speaking about the long-stalled project, the foreign minister said Islamabad would decide on this issue in light of its national interest and commitments it had made. Referring to theexternal pressure, especially from the US, the minister said, “We can’t allow anyone to dictate to us or use the veto.” He said Pakistan expected other countries to respect its sovereignty, much like it respected theirs. At the conclusion of the Iranian president’s visit to Pakistan last month, both countries called for closer cooperation in the energy sector and the gas pipeline was mentioned as one of the projects. Both sides, however, did not say how they planned to move ahead in light of the US sanctions against Iran. Furthermore, Ishaq Dar said he would visit China on a three-day trip from May 13 to May 15 for the strategic dialogue with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi. This would be the foreign minister’s first visit to Beijing after the installation of the new government. His visit is likely to be preceded by Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal’s trip to China. About the currentwheat crisis, Ishaq Dar clarified that during the last tenure of the PML-N government, which ended last August, he did not approve a summary for the import of wheat that had been presented to him. He was the head of the of the Economic Coordination Committee. “The relevant ministry could not satisfy me about the need for importing wheat,” he said while clarifying his decision on not approving the summary. PTI-US envoy meeting The foreign minister confirmed that the Foreign Office had facilitated ameetingbetween US envoy Donald Blome and Opposition Leader Omar Ayub at the request of the US embassy. This was part of a broader series of engagements that the US embassy sought with various Pakistani political figures, both from the government and opposition, in March. This was part of a broader series of engagements that the US embassy sought with various Pakistani political figures, both from the government and opposition, in March. “It was the initiative of the US envoy,” Mr Dar emphasised.

The party, however, clarified that the meeting was facilitated by the FO and not sought by the PTI. Published in Dawn, May 8th, 2024"
"Economic Coordination Committee approves 400,000 tonnes increase in wheat procurement target",https://www.dawn.com/news/1832130/economic-coordination-committee-approves-400000-tonnes-increase-in-wheat-procurement-target,,"ISLAMABAD: The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet on Tuesday approved 400,000 tonnes of additional wheat procurement by the Centre, allowed the import of 200,000 tonnes of urea, and sanctioned about Rs144 billion in supplementary grants. However, the ECC meeting, presided over by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, did not immediately allow the supply of subsidised gas to domestic urea manufacturers. According to relevant ministries, this could have facilitated about 600,000 tonnes of local production — about 445,000 tonnes in Punjab and 165,000 tonnes in Sindh.  An official statement said the ECC approved an increase in the wheat procurement target for Passco — the national agency that maintains strategic food stocks — from 1.4 million to 1.8 million tonnes, along with the required cash credit limit (about Rs41.5bn) to purchase additional quantity. The approval would help Passco scale up its ongoing wheat procurement drive. The prime minister had already announced that Passco, a federal entity, would purchase an additional 400,000 tonnes from farmers after the Punjab government did not intervene amid raging farmers’ anger. Allows import of 200,000 tonnes of urea, okays Rs144bn in grants The ECC also approved the import of 200,000 tonnes of urea fertiliser to meet the requirements for the 2024 kharif season as proposed by the Ministry of Industries and Production, the statement said. The ministry was also directed to continuously assess the urea demand and supply situation and suggest appropriate measures to the ECC in a timely manner. The committee also approved the Ministry of Industries and Production’s request to disburse salaries of Pakistan Steel Mills workers for six months (January to June 2024) and directed the ministry to present a detailed plan and timeline for the future use of the PSM assets. The ECC also allowed apower division’s requestto release budgeted expenditures to clear the arrears of tariff differential subsidy of Rs70bn for K-Electric and Rs55bn for Azad Jammu and Kashmir. This would help ease the power sector’s liquidity requirements. The ECC also authorised the BISP cash transfer programme to arrange funds from its allocated budget for financing the Special Relief Package for Daily Wage Workers on the Chaman Border, highlighting government support for the vulnerable group. The committee also approved supplementary grants, including Rs4.8bn for the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, Rs5.8bn for the erstwhile Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority to clear matured liabilities of the contractors, and Rs3.2bn to the finance division as rupee cover for the World Bank-funded Financial Inclusion and Infrastructure Project (FIIP). Moreover, the ECC approved a Rs162m grant for the Ministry of Housing and Works to repair and maintain public buildings in Islamabad, and Rs2.2bn for the Ministry of Interior to rehabilitate ex-Fata’s temporary displaced persons.

"PM orders action over ‘ineffective’ track, trace system",https://www.dawn.com/news/1832117/pm-orders-action-over-ineffective-track-trace-system,,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Sheh­baz Sharif on Tuesday ordered stern action against the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) officials, including its former chairman, allegedly involved in the installation of an ‘ineffective’ track and trace system (TTS) in various industries,causing lossesto the tune of billions of rupees through tax evasion and smuggling. The decision to proceed against tax officials was made in light of an inquiry report submitted to the prime minister during a meeting about the FBR. The report was prepared by a five-member committee headed by former fina­nce secretary Tariq Bajwa. “The FBR chairman working during that tenure (when the TTS was introduced) was also held responsible for the poor administrative supervision,” said a press release. It may be noted Dr Muhammad Ashfaq Ahmed was serving as the FBR chief when the track and trace system was installed to monitor production in cigarette, fertilisers, sugar, and cement industries. It also aimed to identify counterfeit products and end smuggling. 20-member delegation from Japanese firms to arrive soon PM Shehbaz said that due to “faulty” planning and the negligence in its enforcement, the economy suffered. He asked why certain important provisions were neglected regarding the enforcement of the significant national project. According to the inquiry report, the project director and the member operations inland were found “guilty of neglect”. The report also fixed primary responsibility on the subsequent officials working on those posts. Saudi investment PM Shehbaz also chaired a cabinet meeting which largely focused on the potential Saudi investments, with the premier saying the visit of the Sau­di investors to Islam­abad was a “significant headway” in the ties between Islamabad and Riyadh. The cabinet also allo­w­­ed Air Sial to start its fli­g­­ht operations to China, Ma­­laysia, Sri Lanka, Thai­land, Turkiye, the UK, and Kuwait under the Nat­ional Aviation Policy 2023 and Air Services Agreement. It gave a nod to an MoU [memorandum of understanding] for the formation of a joint trade committee between Pakistan and Cambodia. The meeting also appro­ved the transfer of the Dire­ctorate General of Special Education from the hu­­man rights ministry to the education ministry. It also endorsed the decisions of the cabinet committee regarding the Chinese investment projects taken on April 30, 2024. Electric cars In a separate meeting, Prime Minister Sharif was apprised that Japanese companies have started spadework to produce hybrid cars locally. The prime minister, in the meeting with a delegation of Japanese companies and business figures in Pakistan led by Japa­nese Ambassador Wada Mitsuhiro, said a committee had been formed to resolve the issues confronting the Japa­n­ese firms to promote their business activities in the country.

Ex-PM Kakar denies blaming provinces for wheat import,https://www.dawn.com/news/1832200/ex-pm-kakar-denies-blaming-provinces-for-wheat-import,,"QUETTA: As the wheat import scandal refuses to die down, former caretaker prime minister Anwarul Haq Kakar has said he never blamed the provinces for the excessive import of the grain, alleging that the media is circulating false news about him. Speaking at a press conference here on Tuesday, Mr Kakar said the Food Security and Research Department was informed about the expected wheat production in the country for which a procedure was devised. In response to media questions, the former premier, who was accompanied by federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfaraz Bugti, accused the media of twisting his statement. Mr Kakar was referring to media reports suggesting that he blamed provincial governments for seeking import of additional wheat. According to aDawnreport, around 3.2 million tonnes of wheat was imported between Septe­mber 2023 and March 2024, while the local crop hit the market in April. The ex-PM said the decision to import the commodity was taken as per data of the Food Security Department. “The [caretaker] government planned to import wheat, allowing the private sector to do so. A summary regarding the wheat requirement was also sent, and wheat importation adhered to rules and regulations,” he added. Mr Kakar recalled that before the 18th Amen­dment, the responsibility for wheat production and national requirements, including import and export, was with the federal government. After the 18th Amendment, he added, the provinces make demands about export and import requirements of wheat. “Because our country needs approximately 27 million tonnes of wheat, facing a shortage of approximately 4m tonnes, discussions should be held to fulfil this shortage so that production can be increased and a solution to this issue can be found,” he said. Floodlights in cricket stadium Speaking on the occasion, Interior Minister Naqvi said floodlights would be installed at Nawab Bugti cricket stadium within three months in order to promote cricket in Balochistan. “PCB will fulfil its promise to install floodlights by September. PSL matches will also arranged in Quetta after making the stadium up to the mark,” said Mr Naqvi, who is also chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board. He said the PCB would also play its role in the promotion of cricket in Gwadar and Quetta. Chief Minister Bugti thanked the interior minister for the announcement to install floodlights at the stadium in Quetta. Replying to a question about the prolonged protest in Chaman, he said the federal government had decided to impose a one-document system for crossing the Pak-Afghan border, adding that the government would not allow anyone to cross the border without passport and visa.

Last-gasp Waheed keeps Pakistan’s unbeaten run intact,https://www.dawn.com/news/1832090/last-gasp-waheed-keeps-pakistans-unbeaten-run-intact,,"IPOH: Forward Rana Waheed Ashraf scored from a penalty corner with a minute left to play to secure a 1-1 draw for Pakistan against Japan at the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup on Tuesday that kept his side’s unbeaten run at the tournament intact. Japan had taken the lead from Ken Nagayoshi’s drag-flick conversion in the 33rd minute but Roelant Oltmans’ Pakistan came strongly in the last quarter with Waheed pouncing on the fifth penalty corner earned by his side. Despite the draw keeping Pakistan on top of the round-robin table, ahead of Japan on goal difference, Oltmans wasn’t satisfied. “We can’t be relying on set pieces all the time,” the Dutchman, whose side had won their opening two games against Malaysia andSouth Korearespectively, told reporters after the match. “My players should have pla­yed better, even by trying to get more field goals. As a whole, I’m not impressed with my players’ per­formance against Japan today.” Pakistan next face Canada on Wednesday and Oltmans stressed he wants his side to press the issue. “Playing catch-up is something that I don’t like, and it puts our team at risk whenever we play teams that have immense pace with them,” he added. “This has never been my strategy and to ensure that we don’t play in that way, we really need to start scoring early and dominate through our possession and defence for the rest of the match. This is what I prefer to see from my players and not playing catch-up.” Japan bossed the first two quarters but found the going tough against Pakistan. Pakistan’s Hannan Shahid, captain Ammad Shakeel Butt, Ajaz Ahmad, and Abu Mahmood had their wings clipped by the Japanese defenders but kept goalkeeper Takumi Kitagawa busy between the posts. The Japanese had four penalty corner opportunities in the second quarter but failed to score from any. Drag-flick specialist Nagayoshi, however, made no mistake with their fifth by guiding a powerful drive to the right of goalkeeper Ishtiaq Abdullah Khan. Pakistan began pushing for the leveller and after a penalty stroke was overturned on review, Waheed found the goal they desperately wanted. “Pakistan were aggressive, but we kept pressing them,” Japan coach Yoshihiro Anai said after the match. “We had more chances, but we struggled to convert them. We should have won the match.” Pakistan and Japan are tied on seven points after three matches with Malaysia a point behind in third after their 6-4 win against New Zealand on Tuesday.

The 32-year-old, who was jailed forspot-fixingin 2011,came out of retirementlast month and is grateful to have another crack at the World Cup. “It’s a great feeling to be playing for Pakistan again,” Amir toldAFPby phone from Lahore this week ahead of the tournament in the United States and the West Indies beginning on June 2. “I want to complete the unfinished work and, for me, the short-term goal is to win the World Cup.” The young Amir impressed in all formats after breaking into the Pakistan side in 2009 and playing at the T20 World Cup. Within a year he was one of the hottest young talents in cricket, but his precocious career then crashed to an infamous halt in 2010. Amir was one of three Pakistan players banned from cricket for five years for spot-fixing during a Test match in England after being caught in a newspaper sting. He was later jailed in the UK for six months. Pakistan captain Salman Butt, who was deemed the ringleader, and fellow quick bowler Mohammad Asif were also banned and the pair were jailed for 30 and 12 months respectively. Amir returned after his ban to play for Pakistan in 2016 but announced a shock retirement in December 2020 after poor form kept him from being selected. He will form a potent pace bowling attack with spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi, Naseem Shah and Haris Rauf that sees Pakistan ranked among the World Cup favourites. “The Pakistan Cricket Board and the team management have shown trust in me so I have to fulfil that trust,” said Amir. “I have come back after four years and when you play for your country the feeling cannot be described.” Amir played three of the four T20 home matches against New Zealand last month, taking three wickets in a 2-2 drawn series, and said he felt part of the attack again. “To be honest I felt fitter than in 2019 and until you are fit you cannot express yourself, so I am ready to do better and better,” said Amir. He will be in action when Pakistan travel to Ireland for three T20s in Dublin on May 10, 12 and 14. Pakistan then move to England to play the defending T20 world champions in Leeds (May 22), Birmingham (May 25), Cardiff (May 28) and London (May 30). Brought up in Changa Bangial village in Punjab province, some 60 kilometres from the capital Islamabad, Amir was determined to make his name in cricket after his five older brothers introduced him to playing. He was picked out at the age of 15 by none other than great left-armer Wasim Akram at a fast bowling camp and within two years grew in height and overcame a stress fracture of the back. Amir said now he only wanted to remember the good events in his career. “The 2009 Twenty20 World Cup winning memories are special and excite me to this day,” said Amir, who took six wickets in seven matches in the tournament. They included the prize dismissal of Sri Lanka opener Tillakaratne Dilshan — the player of the tournament — in Pakistan’s eight-wicket final victory. “I was selected for the first time and then became part of a champion team. “When I landed (back) at Rawalpindi airport to go to my village there were so many cars and they were showering flowers on me,” he recalled. “I am lucky that I am still playing. When I came, I was the youngest in the team, so here I am having another chance to win the World Cup and that is the target for me and my team.” Published in Dawn, May 8th, 2024"
Babar’s trophy woes under spotlight as Pakistan depart for Ireland,https://www.dawn.com/news/1831942/babars-trophy-woes-under-spotlight-as-pakistan-depart-for-ireland,,"LAHORE: Pakistan captain Babar Azam gestures during a press conference on Monday.—AFP LAHORE: Pakistan failure to win a trophy under Babar Azam’s captaincy was under the spotlight once again when the side’s skipper addressed a press conference hours ahead of the team’s departure to Dublin here at the Gaddafi Stadium on Monday. The national team isheadedto the Ireland capital to play three Twenty20 Internationals from May 10-14 against the hosts. The series will be followed by Babar and co.’s four games in England from May 22-30 before they fly out to Dallas to feature in the T20 World Cup, set to be held in the United States and the Caribbean in June. Pakistan narrowly missed out on the T20 showpiece’s trophy when it’s last edition was held in Australia in 2022,losing out to Englandin the final. It wasn’t the first time the team had failed to achieve silverware under Babar’s leadership; Pakistan had gone down in the semi-finals in the previous edition and had been knocked out of the T20 Asia Cup by Sri Lanka months earlier. Pakistan’s 50-over World Cup trip to India was also a forgettable one. Babar wants to keep all those memories behind himself. “Past is past. though in the past our aim and focus and goal was also the same’ to bring the trophy home, but unfortunately we could not finish well,” he said. “But we have double the confidence and belief that we will do it this time.” The last six months saw Babar stepping down as the Pakistan captain after the 50-over World Cup, pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi taking charge of the T20 side, before his predecessor beingreinstatedby the country’s cricket board as the side’s white-ball skipper again. The Pakistan Cricket Board’s administration under chairman Mohsin Naqvi also convinced veteran all-rounder Imad Wasim and pacer Mohammad Amir to withdraw their respective international retirement decisions before bringing the duo back especially for the T20 World Cup. The PCB also appointed Gary Kirsten as the Pakistan head coach, though the South African will join the side ahead of the England tour with his deputy Azhar Mahmood to lead the backroom staff. The reorganised, seven-member selection committee appointed by Mohsin has included a number of players — along with Amir and Imad — to the squad, while pacer Haris Rauf has also returned from injury, boosting the options at Babar’s disposal. The batter believed each player was selected after thorough discussion among the selectors — which include Babar himself and the Pakistan head coach. “It is the best combination (in all the departments) and every player is selected after considering his utility,” noted the Pakistan captain. “Even I am thinking we are spoilt for choice in terms of selection especially in the fast bowling department after the induction of Mohammad Amir.” Babar’s observation of Haris in Pakistan’s preparatory camp ahead of the tour to the British Isles — which ended Monday — had also made him upbeat about Pakistan’s prospects in the T20 World Cup. The 29-year-old said Haris worked hard during the training camp and looked fit and hungry for action after making a comeback following an injury that he picked up during the Pakistan Super League earlier this year. “Some time a break from the cricket gives you more freshness both mentally and physically as you feel more keen to play,” said Babar of Haris. While Kirsten is yet to join the Pakistan camp, Babar said the coach was in touch with the players as he looks to wrap up the Indian Premier League season with Gujrat Titans. The Pakistan skipper said he would be ready to follow the head coach’s instructions for the betterment of the team. “If Gary Kristen will have special plan in reshuffling the batting line-up it will be discussed properly to take the best decision in the favour of the team and there will be no ego problem for any player including me,” he noted, while wishing Kirsten joins as early as possible. Pakistan adopted a rotation policy in their recent five-match T20I series against New Zealand to test a number of new players including Usman Khan and Irfan Khan Niazi to find out solutions for their middle-order problems. While Usman, Irfan and even Azam Khan, who failed to feature in the games against the BlackCaps due to injury, are part of the squad for the Ireland and England series, Babar suggested there were low chances the players will be rotated, given the T20 World Cup was round the corner. “Now we will give maximum chances to those players who will be rated as first choice to be included in the 15-member World Cup squad and there is no more rotation policy,” he observed. The Pakistan team departed for Dublin in the wee hours of Tuesday but Amir did not travel along with the team as his visa was still in process. Moreover, Pakistan’s jersey for the T20 World Cup was also launched in a ceremony here on Monday and was attended by Babar, Shaheen, Naseem Shah and Mohammad Rizwan — the quartet donning the “Matrix Jersey”.  PCB chief Mohsin also attended the ceremony and expressed hope Pakistan would win the trophy after a long period of 15 years. He said the team was in the “best shape and the boys were hopeful for the target”. Published in Dawn, May 7th, 2024"
Azhar puts faith in numbers to solve Pakistan’s problems,https://www.dawn.com/news/1831943/azhar-puts-faith-in-numbers-to-solve-pakistans-problems,,"KARACHI: Azhar Mahmood looks at Pakistan’s problems through numbers; crunching them and bringing them to the best use is what will define his newly-assumed role as the national side’s assistant coach. But the clock is ticking fast with the T20 World Cup now just days away. Unlike most participants of the T20 showpiece, set to be held in the United States and the West Indies in June, Pakistan skipped naming a provisional squad for the tournament, suggesting that the side was still under construction. Azhar believes Pakistan are ripe with resources, especially with the return of veterans Imad Wasim and Mohammad Amir — both having rescinded their respective international retirements in March — but the coach is still playing the numbers game to find out the best way to utilise the players at his disposal. In an exclusive interview withDawnon Sunday night, the former Pakistan all-rounder — who boasts an impressive coaching profile with trophies ranging from the English County Championship to The Hundred and the Pakistan Super League — thought out aloud. “I think our team has got much stronger [as compared to when Pakistan played the 2022 T20 World Cup final], and with the comeback of Imad and Amir, now we have got experience,” he said. “We have Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah, Haris Raud has started to bowl very well and his fitness has improved. We can use Imad upfront, especially in the West Indies, Shadab Khan is also there, so our basis, when it comes to bowling, is more than covered.” It’s when he talks about batting, that Azhar gets heavily analytical, a trait Pakistan’s coaches in the recent past haven’t been too expressive about. He has the scoring averages of the world’s top teams, especially India, Australia and England on his finger tips and using that very information, Azhar tends to identify Pakistan’s loopholes, and shows immense optimism about filling them perfectly. “In terms of batting, with the likes of Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan and Fakhar Zaman we don’t have many problems in the top order,” he said. “We are struggling at number three, four and five and we aren’t too good at capitalising the solid base our top order can set. “Teams around the world tend to dominate between the overs 10-20, but for this period we haven’t shown a good conversion rate in the past.” The problems at number three, four and five is what Pakistan tried to address in their recent five-match series against New Zealand, in which Azhar was in charge as the head coach, the position now set to be taken by Gary Kirsten ahead of the T20 World Cup. Pakistan tried the likes of Usman Khan, who was one of the top scorers in this year’s PSL, Irfan Khan Niazi in the middle-order against New Zealand, with the duo showing glimpses of their potential to shine in these positions. Azhar was confident, Irfan, Usman and Azam Khan — who was injured before the series — could make up for Pakistan’s need for power-hitters in the middle overs. But there were the much minute details of Pakistan’s batting show against the BlackCaps that irked Azhar. “To be honest, we should have won against New Zealand, but the series made it clear where we need to improve,” admitted the coach. “Our boundary ratio with top teams is comparatively less, we are conceding a bit too many dot balls, and not running between the wickets as much as the top teams do. “So far, we don’t have the players who can maintain a high scoring rate in the latter overs, but it’s not something to be too much worried about because you can’t write Pakistan off in the T20 format. One player can take the match away in this format and we have seven more T20s to resolve our issues.” Usman, Azam and opener Saim Ayub, for Azhar, have the ability to be the players who can take matches away from opponents with a special performance. But all of them lack experience at the international level despite having proven their mettle in franchise leagues.Azhar believes Pakistan’s investment in the trio will prove worthwhile. “[Saim and Azam] haven’t played many international matches, we have identified the talent in Saim, he has been one of the best players in his position in T20 leagues, but has struggled to convert starts into big runs,” noted the 49-year-old. “Usman, meanwhile, showed what he can do with how he played in the last T20 against New Zealand. If a player has scored two centuries in the PSL, you can’t rule him out. “If you talk about Azam, he has played only eight international games and has made two comebacks but he can surely clear the rope, but it’s not easy to score down the order, it’s just a matter of clicking.” Despite all the tweaking in the batting line-up, Azhar did not rule out Pakistan going back to Babar and Rizwan’s as the teams opening combination, despite the pair being split late last year with criticism over their strike-rates. Azhar realizes the once very successful opening pair won’t be a bad option at the top if Pakistan can find the firepower down the order. “We might go back to playing with the same combination (Babar and Rizwan as openers), we have to have this discussion with Gary,” he revealed. “We are still looking for the best combination; no numbers are fixed. “But we are very clear on how we want to approach batting and looking at ways to enhance where we are lacking to improve our average, which is why we are trying different combinations. If we establish firepower down the order, we can rely on the Babar and Rizwan at the top.” Pakistan warm up for the T20 World Cup with a three-match T20 series against Ireland, starting May 10, and four games against England after that. The national side plays its opening World Cup game against the US on June 6. Published in Dawn, May 7th, 2024"
Afghanistan rejects claim of its national being involved in Bisham attack,https://www.dawn.com/news/1832259/afghanistan-rejects-claim-of-its-national-being-involved-in-bisham-attack,,"The Afghan defence ministry on Wednesday rejected Pakistan’s claim that the plot to kill five Chinese engineers in theBisham attackwas hatched in Afghanistan. Thestatementcomes a day after Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Maj-Gen Ahmed Sharifsaidthat the planning for the attack was done in Afghanistan and the suicide bomber was also its national. “Terrorists and their facilitators were also being controlled from Afghanistan and the suicide bomber was also an Afghan national,” the ISPR DG had stated. He had also listedother terror incidents, including by the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), that he said continued from Afghan soil despite repeated complaints to the neighbour’s rulers.  Five Chinese engineers and their Pakistani driver werekilledin the suicide bombing on March 26 as their bus was attacked in the Bisham city of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Shangla district. They were travelling between Islamabad and a hydroelectric dam construction site in KP’s Dasu. The attack had prompted China todemanda thorough probe into the deadly blast and security for its citizens. In response, Islamabad had announced a swift probe to hold the “perpetrators and accomplices” accountable. After ajoint investigation teamwas formed to probe the incident, action wasorderedagainst five senior police officials. No group has claimed responsibility for the deadly attack on Chinese nationals. In astatementissued today, Afghan defence ministry spokesperson Enayatullah Khwarazmi termed the claims “irresponsible and far from the reality”. He said blaming Afghanistan for such incidents was a “failed attempt to divert attention from the truth”, adding that the killing of Chinese citizens in an area which was “under tight security cover of the Pakistani army shows the weakness of the Pakistani security agencies”. “The Islamic Emirate has assured China on this matter and the country has also understood the fact that Afghans are not involved in such issues,” the spokesman said. He claimed that members of the militant Islamic State group were “entering Afghanistan from Pakistan”. “We have much evidence of Daesh (IS) who came to Afghanistan from the territory of Pakistan, and Pakistan’s territory being used against us for which Pakistan should answer,” Khwarazmi said. He added that Kabul considered the stability and security of Pakistan to be in the interest of Afghanistan and the region and believed in the “brotherhood and good relations between the people of the two nations. Some of the experts believe that public accusations by Pakistani and Afghan officials will further complicate the situation. Former Pakistani Ambassador Ayaz Wazir said a public blame game would increase mistrust and further deteriorate relations. “Both governments should hold a wide range of talks and explore ways for solutions to problems. Pakistan should clearly convey its concerns over the TTP presence in Afghanistan and also pay attention to the concerns of the other side,” Wazir toldDawn.com. Wazir has served as the Pakistan consul general in Afghanistan’s northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif and was part of a negotiation team between the Afghan Taliban and then-opposition leader Ahmad Shah Masoud in the 1990s. He further said that Pakistan should not blame the Afghan government for incidents in Pakistan and focus on security problems. The tit-for-tat verbal response between the two countries’ officials shows the growing mistrust between the two countries despite several channels of communication, including a joint border coordination committee to review security issues."
3 policemen killed in bomb attack in northeastern Afghanistan,https://www.dawn.com/news/1832273/3-policemen-killed-in-bomb-attack-in-northeastern-afghanistan,,"Three policemen were killed and five were wounded on Wednesday when a sticky bomb was detonated next to a security convoy tasked with clearing illegal poppy crops in northeastern Afghanistan, the interior ministry said. The improvised explosive device (IED) was attached to a motorcycle which targeted a convoy of police vehicles in Faizabad, the capital of mountainous Badakhshan province, around 11am local time. “The bomb exploded while the convoy of police forces was on its way to destroy poppy cultivation,” Taliban Interior Ministry spokesman Abdul Mateen Qani posted on X.  The explosion comes days after Taliban security officials and residentsclashedover the violent clearance of poppy crops in two Badakhshan districts, leaving two dead and sparking rare protests. Afghanistan was the largest producer of opium before poppy cultivation wasbanned in a decreeby the Taliban supreme leader in April 2022. Farmers have been encouraged to plant different crops, but none compete with the financial draw of the poppy, leading some to continue discreetly cultivating small plots. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. AnAFPjournalist saw Taliban authorities searching homes and detaining dozens of people near the scene. Images posted on social media, but not immediately verified byAFP, showed a charred motorcycle and a police truck riddled with holes. Eyewitness Aminullah, who did not want to give his full name, said he heard a huge explosion and saw that a convoy of Taliban authorities had been hit.
“Immediately the security forces cleared the area of people,” he toldAFP. The number of bombings and suicide attacks in Afghanistan has fallen since the Taliban ended their insurgency afteroustingthe US-backed government and returning to power in August 2021. However, multiple armed groups, including the militant Islamic State, remain a threat, with regular reports of explosions that go unconfirmed by authorities."
AstraZeneca withdraws Covid vaccine as demand dives,https://www.dawn.com/news/1832257/astrazeneca-withdraws-covid-vaccine-as-demand-dives,,"Anglo-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca on Wednesday said it was withdrawing Covid vaccine Vaxzevria, one of the first produced in the deadly pandemic, citing “commercial reasons” following a slump in demand. “As multiple, variant Covid-19 vaccines have since been developed there is a surplus of available updated vaccines. This has led to a decline in demand for Vaxzevria, which is no longer being manufactured or supplied,” an AstraZeneca spokesperson added in a statement. “We will now work with regulators and our partners to align on a clear path forward to conclude this chapter and significant contribution to the Covid-19 pandemic.” AstraZeneca rapidly developed the successful Covid-19 jab during the coronavirus pandemic which erupted in the first half of 2020. Vaxzevria, developed alongside Oxford University, was at first offered at cost but Astra decided in late 2021 to sell it for profit. But the world pivoted towards mRNA vaccines, particularly the one produced by US drugs giant Pfizer and German peer BioNTech, after rare blood-clot problems with Astra’s jab increased public hesitancy about taking it. Last week, AstraZenecaadmittedthat its Covishield vaccine could cause rare side effects, including blood clots and low platelet count.  Sales collapsed further as global Covid restrictions were fully lifted worldwide and the world emerged from the global health crisis. The AstraZeneca spokesperson said the group had begun the process of taking it off the market in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. The company will work with other regulators globally to start market authorisation withdrawals for the Vaxzevria “where no future commercial demand for the vaccine is expected”.  The spokesperson said that, according to independent estimates, “over 6.5 million lives were saved in the first year of use alone” and more than three billion doses were supplied globally. “We are incredibly proud of the role Vaxzevria played in ending the global pandemic,” the spokesperson said. “Our efforts have been recognised by governments around the world and are widely regarded as being a critical component of ending the global pandemic.”"
Israel seizes Rafah crossing amid global outcry,https://www.dawn.com/news/1832195/israel-seizes-rafah-crossing-amid-global-outcry,,"Rafah: Smoke billows from buildings after Israeli strikes on Rafah in the Gaza Strip, on Tuesday. Israel sent tanks into Rafah, seizing control of the border crossing with Egypt.—AFP • UN chief urges Israel to halt escalation, open key crossings• Palestinian Authority calls on US to ‘intervene immediately’• Hamas official says Cairo talks ‘last chance’ for Tel Aviv to free prisoners RAFAH: Israel sent tanks into Rafah in southern Gaza, seizing control of the border crossing with Egypt on Tuesday, an operation the UN said denied it access to the key humanitarian passage. The military’s thrust into the eastern sector of the city packed with displaced civilians came with negotiators and mediators due in Cairo in the latest effort towards a prisoner release and ceasefire in the seven-month-old Israeli offensive. A senior Hamas official, requesting anonymity to discuss the negotiations, warned that it would be Israel’s “last chance” to free the estimated 128 prisoners still held in the Palestinian territory, including 35 the military says are dead. A Hamas delegation was headed “shortly” to Cairo, the official said. Israel has said it would also send negotiators, and mediator Qatar announced it was dispatching a team as well. The long-threatened Rafah operation began hours after Hamas announced  late on Monday it hadaccepted a truce proposal, prompting cheering crowds to take to the streets despite Israel saying it was “far” from plans it had previously agreed to. Army footage showed tanks flying the Israeli flag taking “operational control” of the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing, the military said, in a deployment that had a “very limited scope against very specific targets”. Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said on Tuesday Israel was prepared to “deepen” its Gaza operation if truce talks fail to secure the release of prisoners held there by Hamas fighters. Earlier, the Palestinian Authority called on the United States to “intervene immediately” to prevent Israel from invading Rafah, the official Palestinian WAFA news agency reported on Tuesday. UN humanitarian office spokesman Jens Laerke said Israel had denied it access to both Rafah and Kerem Shalom — the other main Gaza aid crossing, on the border with Israel — with only “one day of fuel available” inside the besieged territory. At the UN, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged Israel to “stop any escalation” and to “immediately” reopen the crossings. “The closure of both… crossings is especially damaging to an already dire humanitarian situation”, Mr Guterres said, warning that “a full-scale assault on Rafah will be a human catastrophe”. ‘Permanent ceasefire’ Hamas on Monday said it had told Egyptian and Qatari officials of its “approval of their proposal regarding a ceasefire”. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the proposal was “far from Israel’s essential demands”, but the government would still send negotiators for talks. In the meantime, it added, Israel is continuing the operation in Rafah to exert military pressure on Hamas in order to advance the release of prisoners. Close Israeli ally the United States said it was “reviewing” the Hamas response. Hamas member Khalil al-Hayya told the Qatar-basedAl Jazeeranews channel that the proposal agreed to by Hamas involved a three-phase truce. It included a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, the return of Palestinians displaced by the war and a prisoner exchange, with the goal of a “permanent ceasefire”, he said. International alarm International alarm has been building about the consequences of an Israeli ground invasion of Rafah, where the United Nations says 1.4 million people are sheltering. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell expressed concern that an attack on Rafah began despite warnings from the European Union and the United States. “I am afraid that this is going to cause again a lot of casualties, civilian casualties,” he said. Egypt urged Israel to “exercise the utmost restraint”, while the Organisation for Islamic Cooperation (OIC) condemned Israel’s “criminal aggression”. In a conversation with Netanyahu on Monday, US President Joe Biden restated “his clear position” opposing an invasion of Rafah, the White House said. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock urged “protection” for civilians in Rafah. “A million people cannot simply vanish into thin air,” she said in a post on X, calling for “more humanitarian aid urgently”. Medical charity Doctors Without Bord­ers (MSF) said it had begun discharging patients from a field hospital in Rafah and was preparing “for a possible evacuation”. Turkish Vice President Cevdet Yilmaz said the Israeli operation in Rafah marks another war crime by Israel. “By carrying out a ground attack on Rafah, just a day after Hamas approved Qatar and Egypt’s proposal for a ceasefire deal, Israel has added another to the war crimes it has committed in Palestinian territories since October 7,” Mr Yilmaz said on X.

Modi’s BJP toils as Indian elections lock 52pc seats,https://www.dawn.com/news/1832189/modis-bjp-toils-as-indian-elections-lock-52pc-seats,,"SAMBHAL (Uttar Pradesh): People queue to vote at a polling station during the third phase of the general election, on Tuesday.—Reuters • Three Haryana MLAs ditch Modi govt to join Congress• Police chase away Muslim voters from polling booths in BJP-ruled constituency• X told to take down Congress leaders’ animated video over code violation NEW DELHI: With the third phase of the elections ending on Tuesday, the fate of 52 per cent candidates for the 543-seat parliament stands sealed, and analysts were reading the turbulence at the stock exchanges as a sign of difficulties for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Another sign of trouble for the Bharatiya Janata Party came from Haryana where three independent state MLAs ditched the BJP government to join the Congress party. Hitherto the flow of big and small political defectors had been in the other direction — from opposition groups to the BJP. There were reports of police chasing away Muslim voters from polling booths in a constituency in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh. Elsewhere names of some voters had allegedly disappeared from the voters’ list. In the fray on Tuesday were 94 seats spread over 12 states, including all 26 seats in Gujarat where Mr Modi and his home ministercast their votes. The day’s contests included five seats in Bihar, four in West Bengal, 11 in Maharashtra, seven in Chhatt­isgarh, 10 in Uttar Pradesh, 14 in Karnataka and nine in Madhya Pradesh, where Congress defector and BJP candidate Jyotiraditya Scindia was in the race. Of these states, Karnataka and West Bengal are ruled by the opposition. The fate of 285 seats is now sealed. The Election Commission of India (ECI) ordered X, formerly Twitter, to take down an animated video posted by BJP Karnataka but avoided directly sending a notice to the BJP. The video features caricatures of Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge, advancing the party’s recent messaging that the Congress is diverting funds and resources away from lower caste Hindus towardsMuslims. As of Tuesday evening, the post had garnered over nine million views, and had not yet been taken down, reports said. The Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee had on May 5 complained that the video violated the code of conduct, and Manoj Kumar Meena, the chief electoral officer of the state, subsequently ordered X to take the post down. In a setback to the ruling BJP in Haryana amid the Lok Sabha election, three independent MLAs have withdrawn their support to the Nayab Singh Saini-led government in the state, reports said. The three MLAs — Sombir Sangwan, Randhir Gollen and Dharampal Gonder — made the announcement at a press conference held in Rohtak in the presence of senior Congress leader and former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Haryana Congress chief Udai Bhan. After their presser, Mr Hooda claimed that the Saini government had lost its majority. Their extension of support to the Congress, he claimed, proved that there is a wave for the party in the state and that “we are poised to perform well in the ongoing Lok Sabha polls”. Mr Saini took over state reins two months ago in March after the BJP broke off its alliance with the Dushyant Chautala-led Jannayak Janata Party and dissolved the government under chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar. On the other hand, the Indian stock market has been experiencing strong bouts of volatility in recent sessions, leaving investors perplexed, reports said. Analysts have linked the fall to problems Mr Modi is facing in his third term bid. The India VIX index, which measures volatility in the Indian stock market, has surged nearly 33pc in just four sessions in May so far, following a meagre 0.30pc rise in April and a significant 18pc fall in March. On Tuesday, after opening higher, Indian stock market benchmarks, the Sensex and the Nifty 50 soon fell almost a per cent each on an all-round selloff. Both indices, however, pared losses and ended about half a percent lower each. Published in Dawn, May 8th, 2024"

Police inspector Paul Krawczyk said a security guard at the mansion on The Bridle Path road was taken to hospital with serious injuries sustained from an apparent gunshot wound after suspects in a vehicle opened fire. The shooting, captured on grainy security camera footage that has not been released to the public, happened at 2:09am. The guard was standing outside the gates in front of the residence when the shooting occurred, Krawczyk told reporters. “I cannot confirm if Drake was home at the time the incident occurred, but I can tell you that we are in contact with his team and they are cooperating,” the inspector added. He said the suspects fled in the vehicle, but no descriptions were offered. Police taped off most of the area. Several small orange markers, believed to indicate locations of shell casings, could be seen scattered on the road’s edge in front of the mansion. Originally publishedin Dawn, May 8th, 2024"
"‘Met Gala Massacre’ — social media slams fashion’s biggest night, the Met Gala, as Israel invades Rafah",https://images.dawn.com/news/1192421/met-gala-massacre-social-media-slams-fashions-biggest-night-the-met-gala-as-israel-invades-rafah,"The first Monday of May coincided with occupying forces entering Rafah, where millions of Palestinians were taking refuge.","The Met Gala took place in New York City on Monday — if you were unaware, what is often dubbed fashion’s biggest night is a parade of avant-garde fashion worn by A-list Hollywood celebrities. The gala, which attracts mass media attention, is a yearly mammoth fundraiser for the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute. However, this year, the occurrence of the Met Gala — hosted byVogueeditor-in-chief Anna Wintour — was heavily critiqued by netizens because of the worsening situation in Gaza as Israel amps up its aggression. On the first Monday of May, the day that marks the celebration of the gala, Israelcalledon Palestinians to leave eastern Rafah, amid increasing global alarm about the consequences of an Israeli ground invasion of the city. Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Anto­nio Guterres, condemned the order and said it would be “impossible to carry out safely”. Millions of Palestinians lived and were taking refuge in Rafah, however, Tel Aviv has apparentlymovedseveral brigades close to the city. As we watch the massacre of an entire nation from our phones and computers, it is incredibly difficult to celebrate the ‘first Monday of May’ and watch celebrities parade around in outfits worth hundreds of thousands of dollars (which let’s be real, they will only wear once). Meanwhile, in Gaza, threats of famine loom amidst death and destruction. The jarring juxtaposition of the two simultaneously occurring events feels dystopian (to say the least) and is reminiscent ofThe Hunger Games, as several X (formerly Twitter) users pointed out.   People maintained that the dystopian nature of the situation was “excruciating”, especially since pictures of injured children from Gaza were “interspersed” with images of Met Gala fashion online. “Doing the Met Gala at this moment in time feels like how the Germans were still doing big movie premieres in Berlin in 1945,” an X user wrote, referring to the second world war when Hitler’s Nazi Germany persecuted Jewish people.   Others used their platforms to direct attention to the tragedy of Gaza, and called for “all eyes on Rafah”, with one individual emphasising that it was “insane” that some were “fretting over people’s fits”. “I love fun. I love frivolity. I do. But wake up,” they urged.     There was also outrage over the cost of the Met Gala tickets, with each one selling for a whopping $75,000. One individual highlighted that the cost of one ticket could evacuate up to three families from Gaza. “The entire event is a profit-oriented display of privilege and wealth which Isnotreal will probably use to distract from bombing on Rafah,” an X user wrote.   People were also quick to highlight that high-profile events, featuring Hollywood’s elite were often used as a “distraction” to divert attention from Israeli aggression as people’s social media timelines flood with the latest pop-culture happenings. An X user maintained that “Israel always intensifies the bombing when they know the world will be distracted with a major event”.    “The Super Bowl, the Oscars, the Met Gala. They’re relying on you being distracted by terrible rich people parading around doing terrible rich people things while they invade Rafah and massacre thousands,” a netizen wrote, urging people to keep talking about Palestine.  “While you’re distracted by the Met Gala, people in Rafah, the last designated ‘safe zone’ in Palestine, are being murdered by Israel,” another user wrote.  Netizens were also quick to express severe disapproval of the Met Gala, with one individual calling it the “Met Gala Massacre”, indicating that Israel rushed to “mass evacuate Rafah and immediately start bombing” it because the gala served as a distraction. Other users maintained that they found it hard to care about the event “when Israel is actively bombing the last livable place in Gaza”.   “You think your respect for the ‘civilised’ world can’t get any more extinct but then they show you their evil, their callousness, their indifference.”  Celebrities attending the Met Gala also came under fire, with some claiming we live in a “deeply sick society”. Another user said celebrities looked “goofy… posing in their little outfits for the Met Gala”. They maintained that the celebrities’ energy was “clueless, classless and desperate.”   An individual highlighted that the “majority of these celebrities and their designers have shown no spine or remorse to what’s been happening since October 7”.  Some also made comparisons between the coverage received by celebrities on the red carpet and those mourning their deceased loved ones in Gaza. “Nine men tenderly placed Cardi B’s dress on the Met Gala floor. Yet the solitary bodies of infants bombed in Gaza by the US and Israel weigh heavier.”  Another person maintained that a “man carrying a celebrity unable to walk in her tight dress at the Met Gala is getting more coverage than a father carrying his dead child in Rafah”, referring to singer Tyla, who had to be carried up the steps of the museum because she could not move in her dress.  One X user took a kinder approach, as they encouraged people to post “simultaneously” about both Gaza and the Met Gala. “While the met is very fun and exciting, please if you are posting about the Met Gala, please simultaneously post about Gaza and Palestine and everything [that is] happening.”  Meanwhile, pro-Palestine protesters in New York converged near the Met Gala in a rally against the ongoing war in Gaza, leading to several arrests, police said. Among the rallying points were the gates of Columbia University, which has been the centre of spreading demonstrations, before protesters marched through Manhattan to American fashion’s biggest night — or at least as close as police would let them. It was unclear how many arrests were made as stars walked the carpet and posed for photos, butAFPjournalists confirmed several arrests while theNew York Daily Newsreported the number was about a dozen, out of hundreds that gathered near the soiree. Organisers on X posted a flier for an event dubbed the “Citywide Day of Rage for Gaza.” Monday’s protest appeared unconnected to the demonstrations that have rocked Columbia’s campus, culminating in the university calling the police to clear out student protesters. We can’t help but completely agree with all the tweets, it is extremely difficult to turn a blind eye to the suffering of an entire people and focus on what Zendaya and Chris Hemsworth were wearing, or who designed Lana Del Ray’s outfit. All eyes on Rafah. Additional input from AFP"
Fistula and child marriages: The two epidemics plaguing women in Gilgit-Baltistan,https://www.dawn.com/news/1823323/fistula-and-child-marriages-the-two-epidemics-plaguing-women-in-gilgit-baltistan,,"Seema, a resident of Astore District of Gilgit-Baltistan, received the title, ‘Woman of the Year’, not for her achievements, but for a fate imposed upon her at a tender age: child marriage. One can’t help but wonder how entering into a marriage contract at a tender age warrants this title. Visibly upset, Seema recounted her story, explaining why she received the honour. Married at the tender age of 13 and diagnosed with vaginal fistula when she was 16 years old, Seema’s existence has since become synonymous with agony. Every villager, out of pity for her deteriorating health, would visit her, oblivious to the struggle she bore in silence. With no funds for treatment, her father-in-law had even asked the doctor to give her poison — a desperate plea for relief. Before delving further into Seema’s story, it is important to understand whatvaginal fistulais. The condition occurs when an abnormal passage is created between the vagina and neighbouring pelvic organs like the bladder or rectum. This can lead to numerous complications, including urinary and faecal leakage, abnormal vaginal discharge, tissue damage, kidney infections, and various other symptoms. Doctors warn that untreated fistulas can escalate to reproductive system cancers, potentially even leading to death. Seema described the pain to be so agonising that she wished for a quick death on several occasions. It’s a stark contrast to the dreams that typically fill the heart of a 16-year-old girl — dreams of a future adorned with aspirations and possibilities. However, Seema found herself teetering on the precipice of despair, grappling with the grim reality of her life-long disease. It only makes sense for her to be called the ‘Woman of the Year,’ doesn’t it? Her journey isn’t merely reflective of the far-reaching consequences of fistula but is also a testament to the devastating consequences of child marriage. According to aUnicef reportan estimated 18 per cent of young girls are wed before reaching adulthood [18 years of age], amounting to almost 19 million child brides in the country. The number of unreported instances is believed to be even higher. As per theNational Commission on the Rights of Child (NCRC), Pakistan has the sixth highest number of women married before the age of 18 in the world. Theadverse impacts of early marriageare manifold, encompassing the deteriorating health of the young bride, high-risk pregnancy, and impediments to both her education and personal growth. Moreover, in developing countries such as Pakistan, the unregulated cycle of childbirth places a heavy financial strain on parents, as they struggle to support multiple children, ultimately perpetuating poverty within these families. Despite tireless global campaigns and legal enforcement in these countries, the insidious practice of child marriage persists. This prevalence is fuelled by a glaring lack of awareness regarding the severe repercussions of such unions, amplifying the issue. The plight of girls under 18 is particularly dire, as depicted in Seema’s case. Her story serves as a stark reminder of the health complications faced by these young brides face. From debilitating conditions like fistula to a myriad of other ailments, many women are condemned to a lifetime of anguish. While some manage to recover through treatment, others suffer without ever experiencing improvement in their health. Dr Sajjad Ahmed, who offers free treatment to patients atKoohi Goth Hospitalin Karachi, said that a significant number of women travel long distances from remote areas to seek treatment at the hospital located in the port city’s Bin Qasim Town. This reality underscores the inadequacy of basic facilities accessible to women in Pakistan. At the other end of the country, Dr Sher Shah and his dedicated team annually organise medical camps in Gilgit, offering treatment and performing surgeries for fistula patients free of cost. While minor cases receive care at City Hospital Gilgit, those requiring more intensive procedures are referred to Koohi Goth Hospital in Karachi. Dr Sher Shah mentioned how the hospital serves patients not only from across the country but also extends care to individuals from Afghanistan, Iran, Sharjah, and Yemen. Drawing patients from the farthest corners of Sindh, Punjab, Chitral, and Gilgit-Baltistan, including the remote locales of Skardu, Diamir, and Ghizar, individuals recover under their expertise. The hospital has provided free surgeries to almost 40 patients from Gilgit-Baltistan alone. Despite the invaluable services rendered, the absence of more specialised hospitals for the condition remains a gap in the country’s healthcare infrastructure, he added. Dr Nazneen Zamir Farooqi, a gynaecologist at City Hospital Gilgit, gets patients from remote areas of Gilgit-Baltistan, including Diamer, Astor, Skardu, Kharmang, Darel, and Ghizar. In many of these regions, the scarcity of healthcare facilities and the absence of skilled attendants during childbirth worsen the problem. “The pervasive practice of child marriage significantly contributes to this crisis. When young girls are married off, their bodies are ill-equipped for childbirth — a biological reality — as physical maturity is typically achieved post-puberty,” she explained. Consequently, girls under 18 years face heightened risks of complications, and if they contract fistula, their suffering is only magnified. Throughout pregnancy and childbirth, the absence of adequate treatment can result in a spectrum of deformities in women’s bodies, often leading to the onset of debilitating diseases. Among these, fistula stands out as one of the most distressing, inflicting not only physical discomfort but also profound psychological and social ramifications. Girls married off at a young age have underdeveloped bodies and fragile bones. If they undergo childbirth before their bodies have fully matured, they are at risk of developing fistula. Similarly, older women who have borne numerous children may experience weakened muscles, rendering them incapable of delivering the baby during childbirth. In some cases, it may also lead them to develop this condition. In both scenarios, giving birth to a child becomes an excruciating process for the woman, wherein the pressure exerted by the baby’s head against the muscles between the bladder and the vagina may result in the formation of a fistula. In many cases, the babies are stillborn. Without immediate medical intervention, the affected woman is condemned to endure the pain. TheChild Marriage Restraint Act of 1929, a federal law in Pakistan in alignment with international conventions on children’s rights, unequivocally condemns a marriage involving a girl under 16 years of age and a boy under 18 years of age as a violation of fundamental rights. Although each province in Pakistan has established its own regulations, in the absence of specific provincial guidelines, national law takes precedence. Any breach of this law carries severe penalties, including imprisonment for up to six months and fines reaching up toRs50,000, meant to serve as a deterrent against such grave infringements. As per theMultiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) conducted in 2016-17, the prevalence of child marriages in Gilgit-Baltistan, especially in areas such as Chilas, Darel, Tangir, and Kharmang, stands alarmingly high, soaring to approximately 26pc. Despite concerted efforts to tackle the issue, including the introduction of legislation in 2015, progress has been hindered by opposition within the legislative assembly, leading to delays in its enactment. While the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 1929 is in place, its enforcement in these regions falls well short of the mark. And without a legal mandate imposing age restrictions, many see no obligation to adhere to the law. Subsequently, the absence of robust legislation and effective enforcement mechanisms perpetuates the cycle of child marriages, leaving the issue entirely unresolved. Child marriage is not merely a tradition; it has a direct bearing on human health and development. While marriage may bring a sense of satisfaction for many, it also entails significant responsibilities, demanding mental, physical, and financial preparedness. Experts argue that minors lack the maturity essential for a thriving marriage, posing potential health risks. We cannot afford the luxury of complacency while the innocence of our children is sacrificed at the altar of an archaic practice. It falls upon each of us, as guardians of our collective conscience, to demand comprehensive legislation that will dismantle the structures perpetuating child marriages. For the sake of our daughters and sons, for the preservation of their health, dignity, and dreams, we must act decisively. The time for rhetoric has passed; it is now time for action.

From screens to streets: How Gen Z is disrupting the status quo and redefining activism,https://www.dawn.com/news/1829562/from-screens-to-streets-how-gen-z-is-disrupting-the-status-quo-and-redefining-activism,It's safe to say that the kids are doing just fine. It is the adults running the world that are the problem.,"Soft. Entitled. Snowflakes. Lazy. These are some of the characterisations about Gen Z (those born between 1997 and 2012) pushed in the media by older generations who have largely failed to connect with and understand what they are all about. But these disparaging words used to describe the generation are, in fact, baseless — these young individuals are anything but passive. To put it simply, this generation isn’t waiting for change; they’re demanding it. Over the past six months alone, they’ve orchestrated movements that have sent shockwaves through the status quo, leaving elites squirming in discomfort. It’s time to recognise their power, their passion, and their potential to reshape our world that has been long ruined by decades of complacency. Pro-Palestinian students take part in a protest in support of the Palestinians amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza, at Columbia University in New York City, US, October 12, 2023 — Reuters We are seeing this play out atuniversity campuses across America, where administrators resort topolice interventionto suppress anti-war protests and encampments, only to witness a resounding backlash that reverberates far beyond their expectations. Tensions began to simmer on American university campuses soon after the terror attacks carried out by Hamas on October 7. As Israel continues to unleash an orgy of violence on Palestinians — the International Court of Justice has found it“plausible”that Israel is in violation of the Genocide Convention — the atmosphere on campuses has grown increasingly charged. Student groups have beensuspended,walkoutshave become increasingly common, and university towns havebecome the epicentreof the uncommitted campaign during the Democratic primary elections. A coalition of University of Michigan students rally at an encampment in the Diag to pressure the university to divest its endowment from companies that support Israel or could profit from the ongoing conflict on the University of Michigan college campus in Ann Arbor — Reuters Contrary to what the mainstream media would have you believe, the seething discontent isn’t confined to elite or progressive universities likeColumbiaandBerkeley. Thenumbers speak for themselves: one-third of adults under 30 say that their “sympathies lie either entirely or mostly with the Palestinian people (compared to 10 per cent or less for adults over 50), while 36pc of them believe that President Biden is “favouring Israelis too much” (compared to the 16pc or less for adults over 50). This has become a headache for Joe Biden, as he relies on thesupport of younger Americansto secure victory in the upcoming election in November. Demonstrators protest inside the Rockefeller Center asking for a ceasefire in the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, as President Joe Biden attends an interview in midtown Manhattan, in New York, February 26 — Reuters The ongoing conflict is yet another testament to Generation Z’s profound empathy and commitment to equity, inclusion, and human rights. According to anEdelman surveyspanning six countries, a staggering 70pc of Gen Z actively engages in social or political causes. What sets this generation apart is their digital fluency, enabling them to harness digital platforms, including decentralised media, to mobilise, educate, and advocate for change. Moreover,datashows that this generation watches the least amount of television, and prefers consuming content on platforms like TikTok (10.5 hours a week) and YouTube (6.9 hours a week). In fact, the fast-tracked nature of legislation seeking a TikTok ban in America is very much related to thefallout of the warin Gaza, and has unsurprisinglyangered young Americans. Students build a protest encampment in support of Palestinians, at the University of Southern California’s Alumni Park, amid the ongoing conflict, in Los Angeles, California, US, April 24, 2024 — Reuters Engage in conversation with older generations, and you’ll often hear the refrain: “Younger generations are out of touch, indifferent, and perpetually glued to their screens.” Yet, this worry overlooks a crucial truth. As digital natives, today’s youth possess an unparalleled ability to navigate the labyrinth of misinformation, actively seek out diverse perspectives, and circumvent traditional gatekeepers, particularly within the media landscape. Their digital prowess not only connects them to the pulse of reality but empowers them to shape it with unprecedented clarity and purpose. Most importantly, Gen Z is demonstrating an unwavering commitment to a host of global challenges, spanning from climate change and gender diversity to the plight of Palestine. It speaks of their values and sense of responsibility — something their parents and mentors should not only acknowledge but also take immense pride in. Greek university and high school students take part in a demonstration against a planned bill which opens the way for the operation of private universities, in Athens, Greece, January 11, 2024 — Reuters Demonstrators and students hit a wall as they shout slogans during a protest against the Chilean public education system and the results of the referendum on a new constitution, in Santiago, Chile September 6, 2022 — Reuters From Malala Yousafzai to Greta Thunberg — the emerging cohort of leaders, particularly women — is mobilising millions worldwide. For adults, especially those clinging onto institutions and power, this rising generation represents a threat. This is not only because of the fact that these leaders and organisers are speaking truth to power, but because they are seeking to dismantle the status quo in a bid to build something better and more inclusive. Moreover, the discomfort among established elites stems from their utter cluelessness in navigating the digital landscape wielded by younger generations. This new breed of leaders is not only adept at harnessing digital tools but also possesses a deep understanding of how to use them effectively, leaving the status quo scrambling to keep pace. Demonstrators take part in an “Emergency Rally: Stand with Palestinians Under Siege in Gaza,” amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, US, October 14, 2023 — Reuters The unfolding events across American universities serve as a stark reminder: nothing rattles status quo elites more than the sight of peaceful protestors courageously raising their voices. This has been consistently true across centuries. Yet, amid the turbulence, organisation and activism displayed by these students is inspiring next generation of leaders around the world. It’s safe to say that the kids are doing just fine. It is the adults running the world that are the problem."
"People with two copies of a risk gene have genetic form of Alzheimer’s, say scientists",https://www.dawn.com/news/1831980/people-with-two-copies-of-a-risk-gene-have-genetic-form-of-alzheimers-say-scientists,,"CHICAGO: Individuals carrying two copies of the APOE4 gene are ‘virtually guaranteed’ to develop Alzheimer’s and face symptoms at an earlier age, researchers told the international press on Monday. Thestudyis set to redefine such carriers as having a ‘new genetic form’ of the mind-wasting disease. The reclassification may change the current norms surrounding Alzheimer’s research, diagnosis and approaches to treatment, according to the researchers. The study waspublishedin the journalNature Medicine. “Through the data, we are saying that perhaps this is a genetic form of this disease, not merely a risk factor indication” the co-author of the study, Sterling Johnson, from the University of Wisconsin’s Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center told reporters at a press briefing.  Scientists have known for three decades that individuals with two copies of APOE4 gene variant, have a significantly higher risk of developing the disease, as compared to individuals with the most common version of the APOE gene, known as APOE3. About 2 to 3 per cent of the general population, or about 15 per cent of people with Alzheimer’s, have two copies of the APOE4 variant. “This study adds compelling data to suggest that people with two copies of this gene are almost guaranteed to develop Alzheimer’s if they live long enough, and that they will develop Alzheimer’s earlier than people without this gene,” stated professor Tara Spires-Jones, an Alzheimer’s researcher at the University of Edinburgh (Tara was not involved in the study). Dr. Juan Fortea and his colleagues, from the University of Barcelona conducted an in-depth study of more than 3,000 brains donated from the US National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Centre. They also delved into biological and clinical data on more than 10,000 individuals from five datasets in three countries. They found that by the age of 65, at least 95pc of people with two copies of APOE4, known as ‘homozygotes’, had abnormal levels of an Alzheimer’s-related protein termed ‘beta amyloid’ in their spinal fluid, while 75pc had positive brain scans for amyloid. Nearly all APOE4 homozygotes in the study had higher levels of amyloid at the age of 65 than people who were not carrying the risk variant. The findings suggest APOE4 homozygotes meet the three fundamental criteria for being a genetic disease. Firstly, almost all individuals with these two gene variants have Alzheimer’s biology, they all develop symptoms at about the same rate and clinical and biological changes occur in a sequence that may be predicted, the researchers stated. A Professor of the UCL Genetics Institute, namely David Curtis (who was not involved in the research), remained unconvinced of the findings. “I do not see anything in this paper to justify the claim that carrying two copies of APOE4 represents some ‘distinct genetic form’ of Alzheimer’s disease’,” he said in a statement. “No matter how many (copies) of APOE4 one carries the underlying disease processes seem similar across cases of Alzheimer’s disease” he said. The findings could have broader implications for the recently approved Alzheimer’s treatment ‘Leqembi’ by Eisai and Biogen. This a drug that reportedly removes amyloid from the brain. In clinical trials, patients with two copies of the APOE4 variant depicted much higher rates of brain bleeding and swelling associated with the treatment. In view of this, some centres shy away from treating these patients, Dr. Reisa Sperling, who worked on the study, stated at the press briefing. Published in Dawn, May 7th, 2024"
Editorial: What exactly is the objective of the new cybercrime agency that FIA could not achieve?,https://www.dawn.com/news/1831581,"The move will likely create redundancies and confusion, diluting the focus from actual cybercrime threats to the procedural chaos of transitioning to a new agency.","OUT of nowhere, the government haslauncheda new cybercrime authority: the National Cyber Crimes Investigation Agency. This move to replace the FIA’s cybercrime wing raises substantial concerns about the motive behind it. The NCCIA is mandated to handle offences under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, which, activists allege, was used routinely by the FIA tosilence dissent. Of course, conversely, bad actors use social media to spread disinformation and misinformation, necessitating oversight.  But at a time when digital rights and privacy remain key issues for the state to address, the authorities have opted to forgo any meaningful dialogue with digital rights groups, the IT sector, or even the public. Such an opaque approach fosters distrust and scepticism towards the government’s intentions. It has neither presented a clear rationale nor demonstrated the deficiencies within the existing framework that necessitated this move. The reuse of the FIA’s resources — personnel, assets, and existing cases — under a new banner raises a fundamental question: what exactly is the objective of the NCCIA that the FIA could not achieve? If the goal was to enhance capabilities or streamline operations, would it not have been more prudent to bolster the existing framework rather than dismantle it? The abruptness of the move suggests the new rulers are not behind it. The move will likely create redundancies and confusion, diluting the focus from actual cybercrime threats to the procedural chaos of transitioning to a new agency. Also, such disruptions could hinder ongoing operations and complicate international cooperation under links nurtured by the FIA.  Furthermore, the NCCIA, with its broad and unclear mandate, could potentially lead to increased surveillance and data collection practices, encroaching upon the personal liberties of citizens under the guise of security. It appears the PML-N government is working in the same manner as when Peca was beingpromulgated, when no input was taken. The situation has called into question the regulatory environment for the internet in the coming years. Ostensibly, the aim is to exert greater control over social media and to gain more power to crack down on activists, dissidents and journalists critical of state policies. The government owes the public an explanation of the necessity and aims of the NCCIA. It must articulate how this new set-up will better serve the cybersecurity needs of the nation without compromising democratic freedoms. It is also crucial that further developments in this area involve a broad spectrum of stakeholders. Engaging with experts in digital rights, cybersecurity, the legal domain, and the public is essential to ensure that the agency’s operations are balanced, effective, and respectful of the rights it is purportedly designed to protect. The urge to police social media must be resisted. Published in Dawn, May 5th, 2024"
ESSAY: HAUNTED BY HER MEMORIES,https://www.dawn.com/news/1831566/essay-haunted-by-her-memories,With most Western governments refusing to even acknowledge how the holocaust in Gaza has particularly impacted children and women," In war, one of the most affected segments of society is women. They endure the worst fears before the war, try to withstand the humiliation and torture during it and, if they survive the rapes and ravages of war, they end up living with memories that haunt them for the rest of their lives. Three of the best films that beautifully capture this trauma of war in lingering memories of women are Hiroshima Mon Amour, Mrs Dalloway and Sophie’s Choice. Two of these are based on writings by women: Virginia Woolf and Marguerite Duras. Meanwhile, the third owes a lot to its female protagonist, Meryl Streep. Perhaps one of the first women writers to capture the trauma of war in the 20th century was Virginia Woolf. So, we begin our discussion with Mrs Dalloway, which resonates with the memories of the First World War. Woolf was not even 60 when she drowned herself in 1941, haunted by her own depressing memories of the First World War and fears of an impending annihilation of civilisation during the Second World War at the hands of the Fascists and the Nazis. She was in her thirties when she witnessed the horrors of the most destructive war, from 1914 to 1918. Seven years after the end of WWI, Woolf completed her novel, Mrs Dalloway, which examines one day in the life of Clarissa Dalloway, a Londoner married to a parliamentarian. With most Western governments refusing to even acknowledge how the holocaust in Gaza has particularly impacted children and women, Naazir Mahmood takes a look at three Western films that have hauntingly depicted the trauma of war on women and on their lingering memories of it MRS DALLOWAY AND WORLD WAR ONE Just as in her first novel — The Voyage Out — which she wrote at the beginning of the war, Woolf’s Mrs Dalloway also reflects her psychological vulnerabilities. With a plotless narrative, the novel moves along mainly in the characters’ consciousness, addressing a journey of self-discovery and death. Woolf is masterful in crafting stories that address the nature of time in personal experiences. In her novels, she presents multiple interwoven stories and Mrs Dalloway is no exception. Clarissa Dalloway is preparing for a party that she is planning to host the same evening. The story of the mentally damaged war veteran, S.W. Smith, is particularly striking in both — the novel and the film. The film version of Mrs Dalloway (1997) bears the mark of three other women: Eileen Atkins, Marleen Gorris and Vanessa Redgrave. As Vanessa Redgrave, who plays the titular role, is more well-known to movie watchers, a word about Eileen Atkins and Marleen Gorris is in order here. Atkins wrote a brilliant screenplay for Mrs Dalloway that Marleen Gorris directed. Dutch-born Gorris is also the first woman director to win an Oscar in the best foreign language film category, for Antonia’s Line in 1995. Her films mostly investigate what it means to be a woman in a challenging world that men dominate. Mrs Dalloway is one of her best movies, though it remains underrated, as Marleen Gorris herself acknowledged. Vanessa Redgrave depicts Mrs Dalloway as a disillusioned socialite, whose mood fluctuates between delight and depression. Her suppressed symptoms of depression are visible throughout the film. She appears to question — and at times regret — the choices she has made. Her memories haunt her, as she reflects on the life she could have lived with another man, whom she rejected for a dull but more stable person, who becomes a member of parliament. But perhaps the most crucial character in the film is that of Smith who, in an earlier scene, watches his friend get blown up in the ‘no-man’s land’ of the trenches in France. Five years down the line, he still suffers from ‘shell shock’ and has a panic attack outside a shop where Mrs Dalloway pauses. Nearly all characters realise and suggest that World War One unleashed horrors that keep poisoning their lives. HIROSHIMA MON AMOUR AND THE ATOM BOMB While the film Mrs Dalloway is indebted to four women: Eileen Atkins (screenplay), Virginia Woolf (novel), Marleen Gorris (director) and Vanessa Redgrave (actor), the French film Hiroshima Mon Amour (1959) has the mark of another two women: Marguerite Duras as the writer and Emmanuelle Riva as the main female lead. Hiroshima Mon Amour, too, deals with memory and its insufficiency and treacherousness in the aftermath of a major war. In both movies, the women want to retain what they should, but their hopes appear to be fake and forced. The director of Hiroshima Mon Amour, Alan Resnais, beautifully crafts a movie from the screenplay by Marguerite Duras. Hiroshima Mon Amour is one of the best movies of the French New Wave, with an atmosphere that is both foreboding and strange. It is a tame movie, in which a woman recounts her memories of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. There are newsreels and footage of victims, protests against war and memorials in the post-war Hiroshima. As opposed to Mrs Dalloway, which shows London five years after WWI, Resnais’s movie presents Hiroshima 14 years after the first atomic bomb hit it in 1945. While Mrs Dalloway is plotless, Hiroshima Mon Amour also defies any prior narrative structure. The French novelist and playwright Marguerite Duras opened her eyes in 1914, the year WWI started; and as Virginia Woolf had observed WWI, Duras was an eyewitness to WWII. Like Mrs Dalloway, Hiroshima Mon Amour also lacks any real story. There are two accidental lovers: a French actress visiting Hiroshima and a Japanese architect-cum-businessman drawn into a two-night affair with her. It becomes a sad and sensual affair, as the love between the two revolves around a film on peace. While exploring the influence of war on both French and Japanese culture, the conflict between the inhumanity of war and the human side of love stuns you in this brilliant film. This documentary-style film recollects the memories of the Japanese man who fought for his country in WWII, whereas the French woman recalls her days in Nevers, France, when she madly fell in love with a German soldier, who would only come to die in her arms. Fourteen years after the war, her memories deeply unsettle her, as she unexpectedly recounts those powerful feelings of longing and love that have disappeared from her life, as they did from the life of Mrs Dalloway. Profoundly painful memories mesmerise the viewers in this movie, as emotions erupt at a slow pace. SOPHIE’S CHOICE AND AUSCHWITZ Alan Pakula — who in 1962 had produced To Kill a Mockingbird and received a nomination for best picture — directed Sophie’s Choice 20 years later, in which Meryl Streep snatched the Oscar for best actress. Sophie’s Choice stars Meryl Streep as Zofia (Sophie), a Polish immigrant to America, with highly discomforting memories from her dark past, before and during WWII. While Mrs Dalloway made her choice to marry a dull person for the sake of his high status in society, and the unnamed French actress chooses to love a soldier from the Nazi occupying force in France, the film Sophie’s Choice is about an extremely hard decision a mother has to make. In this film, Sophie has to grapple with her memories as a Holocaust survivor and flashbacks reveal her harrowing story from Auschwitz. After the war, she lives in America with a Jewish man, having a fragile mental state. Like the other two films, essentially Sophie’s Choice is also about a woman struggling with her past and regretting the choices she made, or had to make. In Sophie’s case, the choice becomes apparent only at the end of the movie, when she reveals to her young lover what she went through under the Nazi occupation of Poland. When she arrives in Auschwitz, a Nazi officer forces her to choose which one of her children would go to the gas chamber and die. In the beginning, the movie is slow and at times tedious, but as it progresses and more of her story becomes known, the film grabs its audience. In the final minutes of the film, the harrowing scenes of the concentration camp move you to tears. Sophie has a tough choice to make and, if she fails to choose, both of her children would lose their lives. In utter desperation, she chooses her son to live with her, while reluctantly allowing her daughter Eva to go to the gas chamber. The three films we have just discussed have a common streak of memories and regrets, of choices and their aftermaths, and of the devastating impact the war has on women. While the American, Dutch, English, French and the Japanese have all contributed to these films, now, in the face of the death and destruction in Gaza, hardly any developed country is inclined to make such moving films about the children and women in Gaza.

CINEMASCOPE: DEUCE AND ADVANTAGE,https://www.dawn.com/news/1831387/cinemascope-deuce-and-advantage,The new Zendaya tennis fi lm Challengers is reviewed by an expert in the psychology of competition,"Tennis is a relationship,” says Tashi Duncan (Zendaya) in director Luca Guadagnino’s new film Challengers. However, this relationship is not simply between the game and the player. Rather the heart of tennis, and perhaps of all competition, is a three-way relationship between two contestants and a third person. Their presence, and observation, is what gives competition its intensity. Challengers fuses sex and sport in a straightforward but effective way. Early on, at a junior tournament, we see friends Art Donaldson (Mike Faist) and Patrick Zweig (Josh O’Connor) fall in lust with tennis’s hot newcomer — Tashi. They’re good, but not great. Meanwhile, she’s all business, demolishing her opponents. The two boys compete for her attention and one night she ends up in their room, where they share a three-way kiss before she leaves. The match in the morning won’t play itself. The new Zendaya tennis fi lm Challengers is reviewed by an expert in the psychology of competition Patrick wins the film’s first set and he and Tashi get together. Art, however, remains a “good friend”, religiously attending her games even when Patrick doesn’t. When Tashi’s playing career is ruined by an injury, he is there to support her. The two get married and she becomes his coach, the architect of his international success. Meanwhile, Patrick’s career remains in the doldrums, though he and Tashi maintain contact. When Art’s career also hits the buffers, she suggests he play the New Rochelle tennis tournament, at which Patrick will be waiting. The psychology of competition What’s the point of all this competition? Tashi and Art are rich, thanks to their sporting success, but it’s clear that wealth doesn’t motivate them — and Art is nonplussed by the fandom that swirls around him. Perhaps it is the pursuit of excellence that drives them. This, however, is clearly not the case for ill-disciplined Patrick, who spends his time in bars and sleeping in his car, despite coming from an inordinately wealthy family. Art too seems ready to give everything up rather than ruthlessly recover his brilliance. Even Tashi, apparently the most dedicated and driven of the trio, is ready to risk professional excellence for an erotic thrill. In his 1903 essay, The Sociology of Competition, philosopher and sociologist Georg Simmel argued that competition between two competitors is often aimed at impressing a third party. It is the presence of that third person that gives competition both its meaning and its intensity. What’s the point of all this competition? Tashi and Art are rich, thanks to their sporting success, but it’s clear that wealth doesn’t motivate them — and Art is nonplussed by the fandom that swirls around him. Challengers can be viewed as a representation of precisely this three-way dynamic of competition. In the film’s erotic scenes, the desire for Tashi is conditioned by the sexual charge between Art and Patrick. She is attracted to them both at various times. Having apparently “won”, Art remains insecure about his status and the presence of Patrick. The borders between sporting and erotic competition are often blurred. “If you don’t win, I’ll leave you,” Tashi tells Art. Is her incitement to rivalry between the two purely strategic, a means of pushing Art to achieve better performance? It may be. Yet she seems to enjoy the attention of either one when it is on display for the other, be it on the court or in the bedroom. Any tension can only be held so long before one starts to tire, and it is as well that Challengers reaches its stylish pitch when it does. The film ends with a genuine display of affection between two of the characters. This might lead the audience to conclude that an intimate two-way relationship can transcend the competitive urge to perform for another. Yet the very public and performative nature of that moment leaves us wondering whether even reconciliation stems from the need to be wanted, and the desire to impress.

Tax reforms — easier than expected,https://www.dawn.com/news/1831797/tax-reforms-easier-than-expected,,"The Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) recent decision to block the mobile SIMs of 506,671 individuals who failed to file their tax returns for 2023 as a penalty is a controversial move that telecom operators may challenge in courts. It is yet another example of using diktat to expand the tax net and improve tax collection instead of introducing systemic reforms based on best international practices. Earlier on April 1, 2024, the FBRinitiateda mandatory tax registration scheme for retailers and wholesalers in six major cities. Major commercial cities like Faisalabad, Multan, and Sialkot were conspicuously left out. The FBR gave traders one month to register by April 30. Less than 100 traders reportedly registered during April. The number of retailers/traders is estimated to be around three million in the country. Pakistan has been trying to reform the tax system for decades, but the tax-to-GDP ratio has remained low. Meanwhile, low-income developing countries have made progress, with the average tax-to-GDP ratios increasing by about 3.5 percentage points since the early 1990s to 13.8 per cent in 2020.  The World Bank committed $103m in 2004 to a tax administration reform project. However, according to their website, an independent evaluation rating in 2012 showed the outcome to be unsatisfactory. Another World Bank program with a commitment of $350m was approved in December 2023, but it has also made no progress. Pakistan could increase its tax-to-GDP ratio without foreign assistance via Nadra’s stores of information, and an honest will to improve Tax collections grew by just 4pc in real terms — adjusted for inflation — during five years from FY18 to FY23 at an annual average of just 0.81pc. Pakistan’s tax-to-GDP ratio fell from 10.4pc in 2017-18 to 8.5pc in 2022-23, far below the Asia and Pacific average of 19.8pc. The shocking lack of progress is mystifying for a country that has gone to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) arecord number of 24 timesand received millions of dollars from the World Bank to reform its tax administration. Is it incompetence, lack of intent, or a combination of both? As a first step toward reforming the tax system, the government should entrust the job of policymaking tax and regulation to a separate body of public finance specialists, and the role of the generalists in the FBR should be limited to execution and operating matters. Many countries have benefited from the experience of East Asian countries and followed their policies. Some key features of successful reform programmes include subjecting the discretionary powers of the tax authorities to legislative oversight and legal checks and balances, reducing the overall number of taxes to a few, and slashing maximum rates, as high rates have historically encouraged tax evasion. Moreover, rebates, exemptions and special treatments are eliminated or reduced, and finally, tax administration is simplified using technology. According to a World Bank study published in 2020, improvements in the tax administration of over a 100 countries were largely driven by technological advances, specifically the implementation of electronic filing and payment systems. In 2004, only 43 economies had an online system for filing and paying taxes. Fifteen years later, more than twice as many did.  Developing countries like the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia started using technology to improve their tax collection as early as 2001, 2002, and 2004, respectively. Pakistan does not need McKinsey to help automate the FBR’s tax collection. The firm, though widely known for its management consulting practice, can hardly claim technology as its core competence. According to reports published byThe New York Times,The Economist, and other respected international papers, McKinsey has been involved in numerouscorruption scandals, questionable practices, and lawsuits related to insider trading from the United States (US) to South Africa. Pakistan’s tax-to-GDP ratio fell to 8.5pc in 2022-23, far below the Asia and Pacific average of 19.8pc Pakistan’s National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) has a wealth of experience and technological expertise to help FBR automate its systems. It can get help, if needed, from technology companies who have experience doing similar projects in other Asian countries. Pakistan needs to introduce an integrated digital system through which records of interest and dividend payments made by financial institutions to companies and individuals would be linked to the tax system. This is a widely followed international norm. To introduce a digital tax regime, the National Tax Number (NTN) should be the same as the Computerised National Identity Card (CNIC) number of individuals without requiring the individuals to register. NTN/CNIC should be linked to the financial system through technology, as is the practice in the US, UK, Canada, Singapore, and many other countries. At the end of every year, all interest or dividend-paying institutions must communicate the total payment (interest and dividend) made to each recipient, including tax withheld, to the tax authority with the NTN as the reference. To ensure that the financial institutions have correct and valid mailing addresses, over-the-counter delivery of chequebooks or debit cards or any such payment instrument should not be allowed. This delivery must take place through the post. This small but critical detail would ensure that the addresses are correct. Proof of address is now a common requirement of banks worldwide to prevent money laundering and tax evasion. All individuals with income greater than the minimum exemption limit should be required to file tax returns and include the details of interest and dividend payments received from the financial institutions. Since these details would have already been communicated by the financial institutions to the FBR, there would be no question of inaccurate reporting. This single step, if properly implemented, would instantly expand the tax net. All tax assessments and correspondence should be available to the income tax filers online through a central portal maintained by the FBR. The FBR should communicate through post or electronic means, and no physical presence of tax filers should be required except in the event of a legal case. These simple but critical measures can dramatically increase tax collections and reduce corruption. Pakistan has nearly 177m bank accounts and around 165m mobile phone users. There is no reason why Pakistan’s tax-to-GDP ratio cannot be increased to catch up with that of other Asian countries in a matter of a few years. This has been done in so many countries. There is no need to reinvent the wheel, just the will and intention to execute.

Wheat’s tricky procurement,https://www.dawn.com/news/1831796/wheats-tricky-procurement,,"Theongoing protestsby farmers against the government’s wheat procurement policy have triggered a debate. Some question why the government persists with a controlled wheat marketing system despite its widespread recognition as a failure, particularly in supporting smallholders, who make up over 90 per cent of the total farmers. It is pertinent to mention that this large-scale procurement, often relying on unsustainable commercial borrowing at high interest, is usually justified in the name of smallholders or national food security, especially when the announced wheat support price exceeds the international price, as in 2024.  Every year, the government’s intervention in wheat procurement begins with announcing the wheat support price. This matter frequently sparks intense controversy, as farmers and the government are often at odds. Farmers always insist on cost-plus support price, as they have no sensible justification or incentive to grow wheat otherwise. Additionally, they compare the financial returns of various crops and make rational choices based on potential profitability. Their cost structure depends on the prices of agricultural inputs such as fertiliser, diesel, electricity, seed, pesticides, and labour. Govt’s inability to set a sustainable wheat support price policy due to the cumbersome and corrupt procurement system harms farmers’ profits and national agricultural productivity The cost of agricultural inputs rises every year, and since farmers sometimes have to buy these inputs over the notified prices — fertiliser is a classic example — they expect support prices to increase proportionally, regardless of international market trends. However, since we live in a global village with frequent trade between countries, any policy discussion would remain incomplete without factoring in the dynamics of global markets. Data from the past 10 years on wheat support prices, corresponding international prices, and the dollar exchange rate on April 1 — the start of the harvest season — reveal that in 2014, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023, farmers received lower than the international prices. For instance, on April 1, 2022, the international wheat price was $495 per metric ton, and the dollar exchange rate stood at Rs183.4, which equated to Rs4,287 per 40kg. Yet, the government support price was just Rs2,200. Assuming that farmers kept 50pc of the total national production — 26 million metric tonnes — for their own consumption and as seed for the next crop, with the remaining sold, this amounted to Rs678 billion taken out of farmers’ pockets in a single year due to price disparity. However, there is another side to the story. In 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, Pakistan’s farmers received higher wheat prices than international ones (as of April 1). This was largely due to the PML-N government’s much-criticised policy of artificially capping the dollar exchange rate at about Rs100, which made food imports cheaper — a strategy that could not be sustained over the long term. For example, on April 1, 2016, the international wheat price was $187 per metric ton. With an exchange rate of Rs104.72, this translated to Rs783 per 40 kg, while the government paid Rs1,300 to farmers. Regrettably, during these years, smallholders — those with less than 12 acres of land whose interests are often cited in policy discussions — did not benefit from the support prices due to the cumbersome, sluggish, and corruption-ridden government procurement system. As a result, they had to sell their wheat in the open market at significantly lower prices.  Conversely, in years when international prices were high, government authorities restricted the inter-district movement of wheat. They forcibly lifted wheat stocks from farmers’ houses, disregarding even the sanctity of ‘chadar and char-diwari’. In both scenarios, smallholders ended up disadvantaged, while medium-large farmers with political clout, middlemen, and millers were the ultimate beneficiaries of the procurement system. With a carry-forward of four million metric tons of wheat, mainly due to the import of over 3.2m metric tons just before the new crop’s harvest, coupled with thelow procurement targetsset by the Federal and Punjab governments, wheat is currently being sold in the grain markets far below the support price almost equal to international prices. The announced support price has become nothing more than a joke. In this context, if the government finds itself unable to procure significant quantities of wheat at the support price due to persistent financial constraints, a potential policy option could be for the government to stop announcing a support price from next year onward and let the wheat market operate based on market dynamics, similar to the rice and maise markets in Pakistan. However, the government could still procure wheat from the private sector to the extent necessary to ensure food security and price stability. To stabilise the domestic wheat market, the government can consider importing wheat or releasing its strategic reserves, with or without subsidies, depending on the situation. The question is: what will farmers do if the government does not announce a support price and international prices also remain low? Since the production cost and, in turn, profitability per 40kg vary from farm to farm depending on crop yield, farmers with lower crop productivity would try to increase their yields, given the significant yield gap between progressive and conventional farmers. Alternatively, they could switch to other alternative crops like canola, mustard, sunflower, chickpeas, and maise. Already, excessive wheat cultivation has limited the acreage available for chickpeas and edible oilseeds, leading to large-scale imports of these crops every year. In conclusion, it makes economic sense to specialise in crops that enable a more efficient allocation of resources at the national level. However, for the proposed policy to succeed, it is imperative that our grain markets and agricultural inputs markets — especially fertilisers — function efficiently and fairly, free from the manipulation of mafias.

Beware of distractions,https://www.dawn.com/news/1831327/beware-of-distractions,,"Once again, it’s that time of the year when almost all school and college-going students gear up for their annual exams. The results of these exams not only evaluate the performance students have shown throughout the year and affect their eligibility for scholarships, but they also decide university placements and careers. Therefore, needless to say, annual exams of different local boards, Cambridge University, or individual schools, hold immense significance in a student’s life. Given their importance, all students aim to struggle day and night to excel in these exams. However, many distractions come in the way of a majority of the students and prevent them from achieving their academic goals. These outwardly appealing distractions are a complete waste of time and, since time is the most precious thing a student can have, one cannot expect to excel in studies unless one lets go of distractions, particularly during the exam season. Let’s have a look at some of the distractions that are an obstacle in the way of achieving academic success. Social media Probably the biggest waste of time and attention in this era is the inappropriate use of the numerous social networking sites and apps — WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, X, SnapChat and what not. Minutes turn into hours as you keep scrolling down, posting and liking stories, commenting on others’ posts, watching the latest trends and sharing the ‘live coverage’ of your whereabouts. This will never end and can never end! There will always be people posting updates at all times of the day, trends will change frequently and your mind will always be occupied with noticing how many people have liked your post and who has accepted your friend request or sent you one. In our surroundings, we witness so many individuals who were once bright students, but their grades came down steadily once they bought mobile phones and became active on social media. A few of them did come to realise their mistake only when it was too late! So, a suggestion for school-going students is not to have their own mobile phone and, if necessary, limit the time spent on social media throughout the year and log out of all social networking sites during exams. Distancing from gadgets is essential for excelling in exams, apart from studying hard.  Games All types of games are meant for recreation, but when excessive time is spent on playing them, they become distractions. Video games should never be preferred over outdoor games. It would be even better to avoid playing video games altogether and instead spend the available time playing football, cricket or doing exercise. This is because video games are not good for health, many of them have violent and disturbing content, and a lot of time and attention is wasted to move to the ‘next level’ of the particular game, making one addicted to playing them. As far as outdoor games are concerned, they must never be stopped completely, even during exams. This is because they are essential for keeping the body and mind healthy. However, students should follow a proper routine during exams — time should be reserved for them and they should only be played during that time. Playing outdoor games throughout the day, even during study time should be avoided. Similarly, ‘tournaments’ of cricket and football should not be encouraged during exams because they require extra time and attention. Concisely, by keeping a balance between study time and time for recreation, health benefits can be achieved and distraction due to games can be avoided. Television Even though social media has replaced the role of television to a great extent, watching the TV remains a distracting activity for students. Drama serials are broadcast round the clock and they are advertised in such a manner that many are tempted to watch them. When one episode ends, there remains a never-ending curiosity to find out what happens in the next one. Therefore, one is tempted to watch the entire drama serial, which is a waste of precious time of students that can be better utilised in studies. The same goes for cricket and football matches, whose matches are played and broadcast now and then. Even the shortest format of a cricket match takes at least four hours to complete. I am sure no student can spare this much time in the days before the final exams. Hence, it would be wise to turn off televisions during exams. Highlights and even live streams of cricket matches will remain available on YouTube for all times to come, and can be watched during holidays. The same goes for the TV dramas. However, the time for final exams will not come again. Their result, once announced, will certainly not be changed! Social life and friends Since every grade and school follows their own exam schedule, not all students have exams at the same time. This can be a distraction because siblings can have exams at different times, leading to some being free and enjoying their days while others are studying hard. The same holds true for friends and cousins. And this can lead to those studying hard becoming distracted by the fun activities of their playmates, and in some cases, being forced to attend activities and parties being held during their exam time. Those who are free from exams should care about not disturbing others who are hard at studies, and should wait to hold any get-together until everyone is free and can participate freely. And the ones studying should firmly let others know that they are not available during a certain period as they need to focus on studies, so they should not be bothered during that time. People who genuinely care will do their best not to divert a student’s attention. Dear students, distractions have existed at all times, in one form or the other. Wise students who did not let the pursuit of these distractions compromise their studies achieved their academic goals and secured their careers. However, those who got caught up in the distractions spoiled their grades, and in turn their careers. Therefore, it is important to avoid the many distractions of student life because this important time, once passed, will not come again! Published in Dawn, Young World, May 4th, 2024"
Advice: Evaluation or competition?,https://www.dawn.com/news/1831325/advice-evaluation-or-competition,," As examinations are approaching, we will soon hear chants of grades and positions all around us in schools and homes. Well, exams are designed to assess the understanding of all that a student has studied throughout the year. Now let’s focus on the terms “understanding” and “year.” The scores and grades of exams are a result of the accumulated efforts that students put into their studies throughout the year. So when parents, teachers and others praise or criticise students, all their struggles and efforts put in from the first day of the term should be taken into account. Unfortunately, adults tend to ignore this fact and it all narrows down to the final exams and its marks. Also, to top it off, we are more concerned about the highest marks, top positions and distinctions, and whoever does not achieve at least one of these, does not even get a fraction of the attention. But why are we wired this way? One of the biggest reasons for competition among students is the greed for attention. And it’s not only high marks that we compete for, in fact competition has become a part of our daily life, involving all aspects. The phenomenon which once existed only in sports is now inculcated in our behaviour. This high-tech world and innovations have made us greedy for more and more materialistic possessions. Ask your parents about how happy they were when they used to get Rs.5 for their pocket money. Now reflect upon yourself and your pocket money, which must be in thousands, but it still isn’t enough, right? Yes, times have changed and we need to be socially active, and for that we need to work hard to build a good image. But that does not really happen by being known for possessing materialistic things, but it happens when one is known as a kind and generous person. Unfortunately, we are still in the process of learning and adopting modern-day teaching that is being practiced around the world. Thus our students are stuck with reading long chapters and writing even longer answers, and that’s the only thing we are marked on. But other things should be assessed too. Stepping into the practical world requires confidence, some soft skills and the conceptual knowledge of relevant subjects. Hence, the next time you are competing against your classmates, do remember to take into account all of your and their skills too. One might be great in writing down answers, but not have good presentation skills. Or, one might be a genius in mathematics, but they might struggle in geography, while there might be students who would be great in music and arts, and would not perform that well in academics. All these situations are fine, because no one has ever been or can ever be perfect. So if you want to have a competition, have it with yourself. Look into your weaknesses and work on them throughout the year so that your result speaks of your hard work. Compare yourself to your older versions to see the growth within you. When parents and teachers start comparing you with your others, remind yourself about your strengths. To all our high achievers, well done! We are proud of you, but to all the readers out there, let’s not forget that each year many students appear for exams, while the ranks are only a few. So, let’s pledge to not compare and compete with others, but instead compete with ourselves to become better versions of ourselves! All the very best! You all will nail it!

Fighting Pakistan’s food crisis,https://aurora.dawn.com/news/1145089/fighting-pakistans-growing-food-insecurity-crisis,,"The year 2023 ended with a climate conference in Dubai to mark the28th convening of the Conference of Parties. The meeting was the first Global Stocktake, after the Paris Agreement of 2015, to assess the state of global climate and its impact on present and future life systems on planet Earth. The vision for a universal and liveable planet is not possible without ensuring a sustainable food production and distribution system that is just, equitable and orderly, as well as affordable and accessible to all. Currently, the world is embroiled in a rolling food crisis where2.4 billionpeople (nearly a third of humanity) are moderately or severely food insecure, with women and girls bearing the brunt, accounting for almost 60% of the hunger-stricken population. Hunger is on the rise, affecting 800 million people worldwide, with challenges to agricultural productivity also increasing. Each day that delays emission reductions means exposing more people to food insecurity. As the planet continues to warm, food systems will come under increasing stress, setting in motion a chain of events that will reinforce a negative feedback loop. Current farming practices are responsible for a third of all greenhouse gases (GHG). They are also responsible for eroding natural resources (water, soil and pollinator populations) and increasing risks from zoonosis and antimicrobial resistance. Meanwhile, family farms and smallholders (608 million globally) receive a fraction of the sector’s profits. Standing at this critical juncture, it is important to put things into perspective and look for solutions that reduce GHG emissions from the agriculture sector and, at the same time, keep production levels adequate to meet people’s dietary needs. This challenge will require an approach that combines healthy, affordable and sustainable diets with systems in place that tackle food waste, restore natural systems, boost investment in ecologically beneficial and regenerative agriculture practices, and include agroecology as an integral part of managing all future food systems. Farmers need to be rewarded more fairly and their skills harnessed to transform food systems. An equitable approach can help improve livelihoods, tackle environmental degradation and provide food security. However, achieving these outcomes requires a massive uplift in investments from the public and private sectors, including smallholder farmers, who receive only1.7%of total global climate finance. The world’s biggest emitters of agricultural methane and users of mineral fertilisers should lead by agreeing to cuts in the amount of methane emitted by their farming systems by 2030 and reducing losses of reaction nitrogen by 50% by the same date. Agriculture is hugely dependent on weather patterns and climatic conditions. Crops that rely heavily on seasonal precipitation, specific temperature ranges and soil conditions will be affected more severely by stark variations and sudden changes in the climate. Similarly, heat-sensitive and water-intensive crops will suffer a setback due to sudden changes in factors that determine the quality and quantity of yield. For Pakistan, the challenge is amplified by many other factors that contribute to the emerging crisis. Each has its unique constraints that need to be addressed separately but simultaneously to avoid a polycrisis. The unsustainable population growth rate of2.55%is the biggest obstacle to food security. It throws a spanner in the attempt to balance supply with demand. In 1981, wheat production in Pakistan was12 million tons, with a population of 84 million. Today, production is28 million tons, but an increase in population by 187% (241 million) has rendered the 133% increase in yield redundant. The rampant use of agricultural land without any agroecological studies to guide practices has resulted in suboptimal productivity and the waste of natural resources. Under the ‘business-as-usual’ scenario, low yields will become lower under a changing climate, with serious implications for food security. As a lower-riparian, single-basin country, Pakistan relies heavily on the flows of the River Indus for irrigated agriculture. The quantity and quality of water are both under increasing threat from global warming. The Indus derives over 40% of its water from snow and glacial melt, making its flow more susceptible to climate change. The abundance of water that results from accelerated melting will result in flooding, while water scarcity will lead to drought and desertification. Both are detrimental to agriculture and will contribute to the food crisis. Mountain communities that rely on melted glacier water for agriculture are already witnessing the impact of changes in the timing and quantity of water. As the phenomenon hits country agriculture, the threat to food security will mount. Reportsby experts, including modelling projections by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, warn of stark changes in the Hindukush, Himalaya and Karakoram mountains. South Asia warming more rapidly than the rest of the world will put 250 million people who rely directly on the Hindukush, Himalaya and Karakoram mountain system at risk and indirectly impact another 1.8 million. In Pakistan, the increase in population and the decrease in water flow will have serious consequences for food production. Agriculture in arid and semi-arid geographies requires very careful planning to ensure that food systems remain sustainable. Pakistan needs to be mindful and plan carefully. The Country Climate and Development Reportsprepared by the World Bank provide a roadmap for transforming the agriculture-food system. The recommendations include delinking agriculture from practices that push water and land resources beyond safe thresholds, causing the degradation of ecosystems across landscapes; managing and equipping irrigation and drainage systems to cope with climate extremes; removing inefficient and inequitable subsidies; improving services essential for increasing productivity – research, extension and the development of markets; and finally, removing impediments such as skewed ownership and tenure insecurity. As we move forward, it is important to connect the dots between food, water and population to create a sustainable model. Maladaptation in agriculture is not a stand-alone issue. It is closely linked to peace, stability and security. The rising cost of food will increase already high rates of stunting in the country, trigger displacements due to climate-induced disasters, result in demographic shifts with enhanced pressure on cities, increase poverty, and create conditions for conflict in society. It is in Pakistan’s interest to take corrective measures before it is too late. The new government has the opportunity to leverage the Special Investment Facilitation Council(SIFC)to reform the agriculture and livestock sectors and make them more robust and resilient. Notwithstanding the challenges faced by the agri food sector, it still presents a strong case for catalysing growth in the rural economy and boosting productivity and exports. With calibrated management and the right mix of policies, partnerships and implementation strategies, the agriculture sector offers Pakistan the best opportunity to achieve its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) for 2030 and develop the macro-fiscal stability it needs to cope with climate shocks.

"Interview with Imran J. Nasrullah, MD, Golden Agri-Resources",https://aurora.dawn.com/news/1145104/in-pakistan-we-have-to-be-patient-and-take-a-20-to-30-year-view-in-terms-of-getting-things-right,,"AURORA: Let’s start with a brief overview about your professional background and what Golden Agri-Resources (GAR) does. IMRAN NASRULLAH:My role is regional. I cover South Asia, the Middle East and Africa. I have been involved in the agri-commodity sector for almost 28 years, and in the last 12 years, specifically with corporate farming-related businesses. I don’t claim to be an agri expert, but I certainly have experience in building businesses in multiple geographies. GAR is a very big player in the agri field. We are among the top 10 corporate farmers in the world, and have one of the largest palm plantations in Indonesia. We work with our own corporate farmers, as well as with smallholder farmers across Indonesia. We are very much an agricultural farming-based company. We are one of the largest players in the palm oil space, and we distribute palm products to over 100 countries. Palm oil is very versatile, and goes from cooking oil to renewable fuel to specialty fats, animal feed to oleo-chemicals and specialty chemicals. A: When did GAR enter Pakistan? IN:In 2013, as importers of palm products. By palm products, I mean cooking oil products or palm olein, which is then refined into edible oil. All of the top edible oil players – Dalda, Mezan, Soya Supreme and Sufi – are our customers. They buy the product from us and refine it. We also supply products to make shortening, margarine and biscuit fats; we are working with EBM and CandyLand in that respect. We are also into oleo-chemicals (they go into making soap and shampoo), and about a year ago, we launched our dairy animal feed business. Pakistan is now our hub for animal feed for the region, and we are about to launch in the Middle East using Pakistani resources. A: In Pakistan, do you have an agricultural presence on the ground? IN:No. We do not want to be corporate farmers in Pakistan. We want to work with large-scale corporate farmers and bring them up to speed with the best farming practices we have learned over the years in Indonesia. For example, from an edible oil perspective, canola, soybean, rapeseed and mustard seed are indigenous to Pakistan. They can be grown here and the oil extracted could be a substitute for some of the soybean oil that is being imported. We are keen to see the growth of the oilseed industry in Pakistan as a solution to importing edible oil. When these seeds are crushed, a lot of powder – called meal – is extracted and used in the animal feed industry. A: Do you work with Pakistani cooking oil brands only in terms of supplying the commodity? IN:Yes, none of them are into corporate farming; they are into processing. They buy the oil from us and refine it. A: In which areas do you interact with brands in terms of their corporate farming aspect? IN:In dairy feed. The majority of Pakistan’s large dairy corporate farms are our customers. Last year, we launched a product called GoNutri Energy, which is an ingredient that can be added to animal feed rations to enhance milk fat production for greater yield and quality. The fat content in milk has to be high because it can then be used to make butter. We have dairy experts who work with these farms in an advisory capacity. They are basically veterinary scientists and provide technical advice. A: Why does Pakistan still have one of the lowest dairy yields in the world? IN:Dairy yields in Pakistan are estimated at approximately four to six litres per day compared to the 20 to 30 litres achieved by large corporate farms in Europe and the US, and the feed plays only a small part in the overall picture – basic hygiene, the conditions under which the animals are kept, the amount of water and shade they get – all affect yields. This is why multinational farm managers are working with the top corporate farms in Pakistan to introduce best practices. Pakistani corporate dairy farms are doing better than they used to, but they still have a long way to go. This is about the transition or development of the corporate farm industry in Pakistan. When you have a small farm looking at 800 animals compared to 5,000 animals, the scale changes and the overall conditions for the animals vastly improve. A: Which brands does GAR work with in this respect? IN:We work with Nishat, Sapphire, Dayfresh, Everfresh and Dada Dairies. They then supply to Nestlé, Milkfields, Prema and Goodmilk, among others. A: Has GAR not considered entering the corporate farming space in Pakistan? IN:No, although we have been approached by entities in Pakistan. What we are open to, is sharing what we have learned about sustainable agronomic practices – based on our own experience in Indonesia where we work with 7,000 (our goal is to reach out to 100,000) farmers and teach them best agriculture practices. Corporate farming is a science that is transferable and we can partner in doing this. A: How would you describe the science behind corporate farming? IN:It is about putting processes in place to measure performance, improvements and yields, and for this you need players on the ground working on a day to day basis. Then there is the question of traceability. Customers in the developed world want their food to be traceable and to do this, farmers need to be aware of how it relates to them; the fact that if they produce a product that is traceable, they will be paid better. Corporate farming is also about educating and teaching. How do we look at waste? How do we tackle energy and manage water resources? Indonesia’s challenge, and Pakistan will face the same challenge, is land. Indonesia does not want to cut more trees to grow more palm, so it becomes a question of getting more out of the same land. How do you do that? Is it just fertiliser use? Is it about the technology you adopt? Do you use drones to understand soil conditions? All of these things can be developed as part of the science of corporate farming. A: In your opinion, why is Pakistan’s overall agricultural performance so overwhelmingly subpar? We seem to know the solutions, yet we are unable to implement them. Why? IN:Pakistan’s challenges around low yields and productivity are not unique; we see this everywhere. Farmers’ incomes are not high enough and the younger generations do not want to farm; they would rather go to a large city and become Uber or Careem drivers. We have an ageing farmer population across the globe. Then there is the fact that smallholder farmers are not receiving the scale of inputs and the financing they require; there are middlemen (arthis) who manipulate part of the ecosystem, and at some point, exploit it. There are multiple problems and you cannot tackle all of them at the same time. It is these layers of challenges that make a corporate farming structure essential for a country like Pakistan. Corporate farming can bring about improvements; we have seen it in the dairy sector. It is also happening in the potato sector with Lay’s. Pepsi is working with contract farmers. They give them the seeds and the credit to grow potatoes. Imagine if this were scaled up to corn, wheat, rice, sugar or oilseed. If that were to happen, you would have a sustainable long-term future that integrates smallholders into the bigger picture. Apart from challenges such as water scarcity and land degradation, over-fertilisation is a problem. When you export bananas to the EU, they are rejected because the lead content in our soil is too high. Another challenge is growing the wrong crops. We need a balanced agriculture policy. Corporate farming has brought significant improvements in Indonesia, and it is now a G20 country. In Pakistan, we have to be patient and take a 20 to 30-year view in terms of getting things right. A: What is the difference between contract farming and corporate farming? IN:Contract farmers are individuals and they farm on behalf of a corporate entity. For example, Pepsi did not want to get into farming, so they said, we will help you grow the best potatoes in the world by providing you with the seeds and the financing. There are loads of contract farmers growing potatoes for Pepsi; by the way, the Pakistani potato is now counted among Pepsi’s top potatoes in the world. That is contract farming. Corporate farming is when a company takes on 5,000 acres of land and hires farmers as their employees. In Indonesia, in addition to their own farmers, corporate farms by law have to include a percentage of smallholders, which is a way of bringing people out of poverty – a very progressive way of doing things. It is something that could eventually happen in Pakistan. A: Is the Lay’s potato you are talking about accessible to the ordinary consumer? IN:The scale is too small and upscaling this kind of thing is beyond Pepsi’s capabilities. A: Which means that good quality produce is not available to Pakistani consumers? IN:Yes. However, good quality milk in boxes is available, although only a tiny minority can afford to buy it. The problem is lack of regulation. Legislation needs to come in to ensure better quality food. At the very minimum, if legislation regarding pasteurisation is passed and implemented, there will be an increase in demand for better quality milk, which in turn will increase demand for better quality feed and hence, a cleaner supply chain. Governments need to draft legislation around food safety and standards, and players like ourselves can help because we work with food authorities around the world. That is where things need to go. If proper legislation is enacted in the milk space, the corporate dairy farm sector will skyrocket and they will be able to produce value added products, such as hydrated milk or infant formulas, and export them. Governments need to play their part in terms of legislation and implementation, and then the private sector will come in and take over. The fact that we do not have good quality potatoes is because there are no regulations regarding food quality, and if food quality is not a requirement, why would the farmer invest in producing it for the mass market? A: Is this lack of regulation due to apathy or vested interests? IN:I don’t want to get into a political debate, but agriculture is no different from any other sector in Pakistan. As to whether it is vested interests or apathy, I would say that it is a combination of multiple things. Today, two-thirds of the population is food insecure. Had measures been taken earlier, we would not be in this situation. We would not be massively importing food or, at the very least, we would be exporting food that we can produce well and not importing food we can produce ourselves. A: Is GAR involved in any other agriculture related areas apart from palm oil and dairy feed? IN:We also do sugar. We trade about a million tons of sugar. We bought sugar last year from Pakistan and traded it to West Africa. However, Pakistan’s sugar crop is inconsistent and fraught with its own challenges due to government regulations and other issues, so it is not a consistent export. One also has to keep in mind that Pakistan’s water resources are scarce and sugar is a huge water consumer. We are also working with some oleo-chemical players on the production of soap and shampoo in Pakistan. We are also working with top-quality Pakistani food companies. Companies like CandyLand, EBM and Young’s are trying to innovate in terms of their product quality. We work with global accounts such as McDonald’s, Krispy Kreme and Pizza Hut to develop recipes for better quality products and we are trying to build that skill in Pakistan. A: With brands like EBM or CandyLand are you just supplying a product or is there more to it? IN:We are certainly supplying product, but we are also having broader conversations with brands in terms of an urban population that is becoming more conscious about food safety and standards. There are 30 million people in Karachi and both housewives and younger generations are asking for better quality food. So brands are asking us questions about how they can make their products better and this is where our expertise becomes relevant. There is a huge opportunity to work with brands to make their product better in terms of taste and nutrition. This is what differentiates us from many of our competitors who just sell product. We have an innovation centre in Jakarta where our chefs are developing better quality products with better flavours and taste. One of our dreams is to have a similar centre in the region, maybe Dubai. A lot more Pakistani companies are participating in Gulfood Dubai. A:Is Pakistan putting the right emphasis on training top quality nutritionists and food scientists? IN:There is a lot of potential in Pakistan, but we are not producing the right level of talent systematically. The private sector are training people for their own needs and sending them abroad. It goes back to the question of regulation and legislation. If there is no demand for good quality food, you are not going to have a demand for qualified food scientists; they would rather go to Dubai or elsewhere, because the environment in Pakistan doesn’t exist. There has to be an ecosystem to absorb that talent. A: Does Pakistan have the rudiments necessary to create an ecosystem that prioritises food safety and standards? IN:I don’t think there is an ecosystem per se, although I see islands. My hope is that these islands connect and become a big landmass. Imran J. Nasrullah was in conversation with Mariam Ali Baig.

Private investment in agriculture,https://aurora.dawn.com/news/1145104/in-pakistan-we-have-to-be-patient-and-take-a-20-to-30-year-view-in-terms-of-getting-things-right,,"AURORA: Let’s start with a brief overview about your professional background and what Golden Agri-Resources (GAR) does. IMRAN NASRULLAH:My role is regional. I cover South Asia, the Middle East and Africa. I have been involved in the agri-commodity sector for almost 28 years, and in the last 12 years, specifically with corporate farming-related businesses. I don’t claim to be an agri expert, but I certainly have experience in building businesses in multiple geographies. GAR is a very big player in the agri field. We are among the top 10 corporate farmers in the world, and have one of the largest palm plantations in Indonesia. We work with our own corporate farmers, as well as with smallholder farmers across Indonesia. We are very much an agricultural farming-based company. We are one of the largest players in the palm oil space, and we distribute palm products to over 100 countries. Palm oil is very versatile, and goes from cooking oil to renewable fuel to specialty fats, animal feed to oleo-chemicals and specialty chemicals. A: When did GAR enter Pakistan? IN:In 2013, as importers of palm products. By palm products, I mean cooking oil products or palm olein, which is then refined into edible oil. All of the top edible oil players – Dalda, Mezan, Soya Supreme and Sufi – are our customers. They buy the product from us and refine it. We also supply products to make shortening, margarine and biscuit fats; we are working with EBM and CandyLand in that respect. We are also into oleo-chemicals (they go into making soap and shampoo), and about a year ago, we launched our dairy animal feed business.
